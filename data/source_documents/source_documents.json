    "english_text": "Heart Failure - Discharge\n\nHeart failure is a condition in which the heart is no longer able to pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body efficiently. When symptoms become severe, a hospital stay may be necessary. This article discusses what you need to do to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.\n\nWhen You're in the Hospital\nYou were in the hospital to have your heart failure treated. Heart failure occurs when the muscles of your heart are weak or have trouble relaxing, or both.\n\nYour heart is a pump that moves fluids through your body. As with any pump, if the flow out of the pump is not enough, fluids do not move well and they get stuck in places they should not be. In your body, this means that fluid collects in your lungs, abdomen, and legs.\n\nWhile you were in the hospital:\nYour health care team closely adjusted the fluids you drank or received through an intravenous (IV) line. They also watched and measured how much urine you produced.\nYou may have received medicines to help your body get rid of extra fluids.\nYou may have had tests to check how well your heart was working.\n\nWhat to Expect at Home\nYour energy will slowly return. You may need help taking care of yourself when you first get home. You may feel sad or depressed. All of these things are normal.\n\nChecking Yourself at Home\nWeigh yourself every morning on the same scale when you get up -- before you eat but after you use the bathroom. Make sure you are wearing similar clothing each time you weigh yourself. Write down your weight every day on a chart so that you can keep track of it.\n\nThroughout the day, ask yourself:\nIs my energy level normal?\nDo I get more short of breath when I am doing my everyday activities?\nAre my clothes or shoes feeling tight?\nAre my ankles or legs swelling?\nAm I coughing more often? Does my cough sound wet?\nDo I get short of breath at night or when I lie down?\n\nIf you are having new (or different) symptoms, ask yourself:\n\nDid I eat something different than usual or try a new food?\nDid I take all of my medicines the right way at the right times?\n\nDiet and Fluids\nYour health care provider may ask you to limit how much you drink.\n\nWhen your heart failure is not very severe, you may not have to limit your fluids too much.\nAs your heart failure gets worse, you may be asked to limit fluids to 6 to 9 cups (1.5 to 2 liters) a day.\n\nYou will need to eat less salt. Salt can make you thirsty, and being thirsty can cause you to drink too much fluid. Extra salt also makes fluid stay in your body. Lots of foods that do not taste salty, or that you do not add salt to, still contain a lot of salt.\n\nYou may need to take a diuretic, or water pill.\n\nDo not drink alcohol. Alcohol makes it harder for your heart muscles to work. Ask your provider what to do on special occasions where alcohol and foods you are trying to avoid will be served.\n\nIf you smoke, stop. Ask for help quitting if you need it. Do not let anybody smoke in your home.\n\nLearn more about what you should eat to make your heart and blood vessels healthier.\nAvoid fatty foods.\nStay away from fast-food restaurants.\nAvoid some prepared and frozen foods.\n\nTry to stay away from things that are stressful for you. If you feel stressed all the time, or if you are very sad, talk with your provider who can refer you to a counselor.\n\nTaking Your Heart Drugs\nHave your entire medicine prescriptions filled before you go home. It is very important that you take your medicines the way your provider told you to. Do not take any other medicines or herbs without asking your provider about them first.\n\nTake your medicines with water. Do not take them with grapefruit juice, since it may change how your body absorbs certain medicines. Ask your provider or pharmacist if this will be a problem for you.\n\nThe medicines below are given to many people who have heart failure. Sometimes there is a reason they may not be safe to take, though. These medicines may help protect your heart. Talk with your provider if you are not already on any of these medicines:\nAntiplatelet medicines (blood thinners) such as aspirin or clopidogrel (Plavix) to help keep your blood from clotting\nAnticoagulant medicines (blood thinners) such as warfarin (Coumadin) to help keep your blood from clotting\nBeta blocker and ACE inhibitor medicines as well as other medicines to lower your blood pressure and treat the heart muscle\nStatins or other medicines to lower your cholesterol\n\nTalk to your provider before changing the way you take your medicines. Never just stop taking these medicines for your heart, or any medicines you may be taking for diabetes, high blood pressure, or other medical conditions you have.\n\nIf you are taking a blood thinner, such as warfarin (Coumadin), you will need to have extra blood tests to make sure your dose is correct. Some other blood thinners do not require this.\n\nActivity\nYour provider may refer you to a cardiac rehabilitation program. There, you will learn how to slowly increase your exercise and how to take care of your heart disease. Make sure you avoid heavy lifting.\n\nMake sure you know the warning signs of heart failure and of a heart attack. Know what to do when you have chest pain, or angina.\n\nAlways ask your provider before starting sexual activity again. Do not take sildenafil (Viagra), or vardenafil (Levitra), tadalafil (Cialis), or any herbal remedy for erection problems without checking first.\n\nMake sure your home is set up to be safe and easy for you for you to move around in and avoid falls.\n\nIf you are unable to walk around very much, ask your provider for exercises you can do while you are sitting.\n\nFollow-up\nMake sure you get a flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine on a schedule recommended by your provider (usually every year). You may also need a pneumococcal vaccine (pneumonia shot). Ask your provider about this.\n\nYour provider may call you to see how you are doing and to make sure you are checking your weight and taking your medicines.\n\nYou will need follow-up appointments at your provider's office.\n\nYou will likely need to have certain lab tests to check your sodium and potassium levels and monitor how your kidneys are working.\n\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nContact your provider if:\nYou gain more than 2 pounds (lb) (1 kilogram, kg) in a day, or 5 lb (2 kg) in a week.\nYou are very tired and weak.\nYou are dizzy and lightheaded.\nYou are more short of breath when you are doing your normal activities.\nYou have new shortness of breath when you are sitting.\nYou need to sit up or use more pillows at night because you are short of breath when you are lying down.\nYou wake up 1 to 2 hours after falling asleep because you are short of breath.\nYou are wheezing and having trouble breathing.\nYou feel pain or pressure in your chest.\nYou have a cough that does not go away. It may be dry and hacking, or it may sound wet and bring up pink, foamy spit.\nYour have swelling in your feet, ankles or legs.\nYou have to urinate a lot, particularly at night.\nYou have stomach pain or tenderness.\nYou have symptoms that you think may be from your medicines.\nYour pulse, or heartbeat, gets very slow or very fast, or it is not steady.",

Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines with it or at different times, and eating certain foods can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.\n\nWhat to Expect at Home\nWarfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. This may be important if:\n\nYou have already had blood clots in your leg, arm, heart, or brain.\nYour health care provider is worried that a blood clot may form in your body. People who have a new heart valve, a large heart, a heart rhythm that is not normal, or other heart problems may need to take warfarin.\nWhen you are taking warfarin, you may be more likely to bleed, even from activities you have always done.\n\nChanging how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines, and eating certain foods all can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.\n\nTaking Warfarin\nIt is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told.\n\nTake only the dose your provider has prescribed. If you miss a dose, contact your provider for advice.\nIf your pills look different from your last prescription, contact your provider or pharmacist right away. The tablets are different colors, depending on the dose. The dose is also marked on the pill.\nYour provider will test your blood at regular visits. This is called an INR test or sometimes a PT test. The test helps make sure you are taking the right amount of warfarin to help your body.\n\nAlcohol and some medicines can change how warfarin works in your body.\n\nDO NOT drink alcohol while you are taking warfarin.\nTalk with your provider before taking any other over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, supplements, cold medicines, antibiotics, or other medicines.\nTell all of your providers that you are taking warfarin. This includes doctors, nurses, and your dentist. Sometimes, you may need to stop or take less warfarin before having a procedure. Always talk to the provider who prescribed the warfarin before stopping or changing your dose.\n\nAsk about wearing a medical alert bracelet or necklace that says you are taking warfarin. This will let providers who take care of you in an emergency know that you are taking this medicine.\n\nYour Diet\nSome foods can change the way warfarin works in your body. Make sure you check with your provider before making any big changes in your diet.\n\nYou do not have to avoid these foods, but try to eat or drink only small amounts of them. At the least, do not change the amount of these foods and products you eat day-to-day or week-to-week:\n\nMayonnaise and some oils, such as canola, olive, and soybean oils\nBroccoli, Brussels sprouts, and raw green cabbage\nEndive, lettuce, spinach, parsley, watercress, garlic, and scallions (green onions)\nKale, collard greens, mustard greens, and turnip greens\nCranberry juice and green tea\nFish oil supplements\nHerbs used in herbal teas\n\nOther Tips\nBecause being on warfarin can make you bleed more than usual:\n\nYou should avoid activities that could cause an injury or open wound, such as contact sports.\nUse a soft toothbrush, waxed dental floss, and an electric razor. Be extra careful around sharp objects.\nPrevent falls in your home by having good lighting and removing loose rugs and electric cords from pathways. Do not reach or climb for objects in the kitchen. Put things where you can get to them easily. Avoid walking on ice, wet floors, or other slippery or unfamiliar surfaces.\n\nMake sure you look for unusual signs of bleeding or bruising on your body.\n\nLook for bleeding from the gums, blood in your urine, bloody or dark stool, nosebleeds, or vomiting blood.\nWomen need to watch for extra bleeding during their period or between periods.\nDark red or black bruises may appear. If this happens, call your provider right away.\n\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nContact your provider if you have:\n\nA serious fall, or if you hit your head\nPain, discomfort, swelling at an injection or injury site\nA lot of bruising on your skin\nA lot of bleeding (such as nosebleeds or bleeding gums)\nBloody or dark brown urine or stool\nHeadache, dizziness, or weakness\nA fever or other illness, including vomiting, diarrhea, or infection\nYou become pregnant or are planning to become pregnant",

    "english_text": "Low blood sugar - self-care\n\nLow blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.\n\nWhat is Low Blood Sugar?\nLow blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.\n\nYou are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:\n\nInsulin\nGlyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)\nYou are also at increased risk of having low blood sugar if you have had previous low blood sugar levels.\n\nRecognizing Low Blood Sugar\nKnow how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:\n\nWeakness or feeling tired\nShaking\nSweating\nHeadache\nHunger\nFeeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious\nFeeling cranky\nTrouble thinking clearly\nDouble or blurry vision\nFast or pounding heartbeat\nSometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:\n\nFaint\nHave a seizure\nGo into a coma\nSome people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.\n\nCheck Your Blood Sugar Often\nTalk with your provider about when you should check your blood sugar every day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.\n\nThe most common causes of low blood sugar are:\n\nTaking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time\nTaking too much insulin or diabetes medicine\nTaking insulin to correct high blood sugar without eating any food\nNot eating enough during meals or snacks after you have taken insulin or diabetes medicine\nSkipping meals (this may mean that your dose of long-acting insulin is too high, so you should talk to your provider)\nWaiting too long after taking your medicine to eat your meals\nExercising a lot or at a time that is unusual for you\nNot checking your blood sugar or not adjusting your insulin dose before exercising\nDrinking alcohol\n\nPreventing Low Blood Sugar\nPreventing low blood sugar is better than having to treat it. Always have a source of fast-acting sugar with you.\n\nWhen you exercise, check your blood sugar levels. Make sure you have snacks with you.\nTalk to your provider about reducing insulin doses on days that you exercise.\nAsk your provider if you need a bedtime snack to prevent low blood sugar overnight. Protein snacks may be best.\nDo not drink alcohol without eating food. Women should limit alcohol to 1 drink a day and men should limit alcohol to 2 drinks a day. Family and friends should know how to help. They should know:\n\nThe symptoms of low blood sugar and how to tell if you have them.\nHow much and what kind of food they should give you.\nWhen to call for emergency help.\nHow to inject glucagon, a hormone that increases your blood sugar. Your provider will tell you when to use this medicine.\nIf you have diabetes, always wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. This helps emergency medical workers know you have diabetes.\n\nWhen Your Blood Sugar Gets Low\nCheck your blood sugar whenever you have symptoms of low blood sugar. If your blood sugar is below 70 mg/dL, treat yourself right away.\n\n1. Eat something that has about 15 grams (g) of carbohydrates. Examples are:\n\n4 glucose tablets\nOne half cup (4 ounces or 120 mL) of fruit juice or regular, non-diet soda\n5 or 6 hard candies\n1 tablespoon (tbsp) or 15 mL of sugar, plain or dissolved in water\n1 tbsp (15 mL) of honey or syrup\n\n2. Wait about 15 minutes before eating any more. Be careful not to eat too much. This can cause high blood sugar and weight gain.\n\n3. Check your blood sugar again.\n\n4. If you do not feel better in 15 minutes and your blood sugar is still lower than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), eat another snack with 15 g of carbohydrates.\n\nYou may need to eat a snack with carbohydrates and protein if your blood sugar is in a safer range -- over 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) -- and your next meal is more than an hour away.\n\nAsk your provider how to manage this situation. If these steps for raising your blood sugar do not work, contact your provider right away.\n\nTalk to Your Doctor or Nurse\nIf you use insulin and your blood sugar is frequently or consistently low, ask your provider or nurse if you:\n\nAre injecting your insulin the right way\nNeed a different type of needle\nShould change how much insulin you take\nShould change the kind of insulin you take\nDo not make any changes without talking to your provider or nurse first.\n\nSometimes hypoglycemia can be due to accidently taking the wrong medicines. Check your medicines with your pharmacist.\n\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nIf signs of low blood sugar do not improve after you have eaten a snack that contains sugar, have someone drive you to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number. Do not drive when your blood sugar is low.\n\nGet medical help right away for a person with low blood sugar if the person is not alert or cannot be woken up as this is a medical emergency.",

Bring enough medicine with you when you travel.\n\nShort-acting Beta-agonists\nShort-acting beta-agonists are the most common quick-relief medicines for treating asthma attacks and are considered to be bronchodilators.\n\nThey can be used just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise. They work by relaxing the muscles of your airways, and this lets you breathe better during an attack.\n\nTell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more to control your asthma symptoms. Your asthma may not be under control, and your provider may need to change your dose of daily control medicines.\n\nSome quick-relief asthma medicines include:\n\nAlbuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)\nLevalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)\nMetaproterenol\nTerbutaline\nShort-acting beta-agonists may cause these side effects:\n\nAnxiety.\nFast and irregular heartbeats. Call your provider right away if you have this side effect.\nHeadache.\nRestlessness.\nTremor (your hand or another part of your body may shake).\nOral Steroids\nYour provider might prescribe oral steroids when you have an asthma attack that is not going away. These are medicines that you take by mouth as pills, capsules, or liquids.\n\nOral steroids are not quick-relief medicines but are often given for 7 to 14 days when your symptoms flare-up.\n\nOral steroids include:\n\nMethylprednisolone\nPrednisone\nPrednisolone",

    "english_text": "Surgical wound care - open\n\nAn incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the kind of surgery you had.\n\nSometimes, an incision breaks open. This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).\n\nWhat to Expect at Home\nIf your surgeon does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. A dressing helps absorb drainage and keep the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.\n\nProper Handwashing\nIt is important to clean your hands before you change your dressing. You can use an alcohol-based cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands using these steps:\n\nTake all jewelry off your hands.\nWet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.\nAdd soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing \"Happy Birthday\" or the \"Alphabet Song\" one time through). Clean under your nails also.\nRinse well.\nDry with a clean towel.\nRemoving the Old Dressing\nYour health care provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. To prepare for the dressing change:\n\nClean your hands before touching the dressing.\nMake sure you have all the supplies handy.\nHave a clean work surface.\nRemove the old dressing:\n\nCarefully loosen the tape from your skin.\nUse a clean (not sterile) medical glove to grab the old dressing and pull it off.\nIf the dressing sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your provider instructed you to pull it off dry.\nPut the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.\nClean your hands again after you take off the old dressing.\nCaring for the Wound\nYou may use a gauze pad or soft cloth to clean the skin around your wound:\n\nUse a normal saline solution (salt water) or mild soapy water.\nSoak the gauze or cloth in the saline solution or soapy water, and gently dab or wipe the skin with it.\nTry to remove all drainage and any dried blood or other matter that may have built up on the skin.\nDo not use skin cleansers, alcohol, peroxide, iodine, or soap with antibacterial chemicals. These can damage the wound tissue and slow healing.\nYour provider may also ask you to irrigate, or wash out, your wound:\n\nFill a syringe with salt water or soapy water, whichever your provider recommends.\nHold the syringe 1 to 6 inches (2.5 to 15 centimeters) away from the wound. Spray hard enough into the wound to wash away drainage and discharge.\nUse a clean soft, dry cloth or piece of gauze to carefully pat the wound dry.\nDo not put any lotion, cream, or herbal remedies on or around your wound, unless your provider has said it is OK.\n\nPutting on the New Dressing\nPlace the clean dressing on the wound as your provider taught you to. You may be using a wet-to-dry dressing that requires moistening the dressing before applying it.\n\nClean your hands when you are finished.\n\nThrow away the old dressing and other used supplies in a waterproof plastic bag. Close it tightly then double it before putting it in the trash.\n\nWash any soiled laundry from the dressing change separately from other laundry. Ask your provider if you need to add bleach to the wash water.\n\nUse a dressing only once. Never reuse it.\n\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nContact your provider if:\n\nThere is more redness, pain, swelling, or bleeding at the wound site.\nThe wound is larger or deeper, or it looks dried out or dark.\nThe drainage coming from or around the wound increases or becomes thick, tan, green, or yellow, or smells bad (which indicates pus).\nYour temperature is 100.5°F (38°C) or higher.",

This article tells you what you need to do to care for your new hip when you leave the hospital.\n\nWhen You're in the Hospital\nYou had a hip joint replacement surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.\n\nWhat to Expect at Home\nBy the time you go home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without needing much help. Most people do not need them after 2 to 4 weeks. Check with your surgeon about when to stop using crutches.\n\nYou should also be able to dress yourself with only a little help and be able to get into and out of your bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help.\n\nYou will need to be careful that you do not dislocate your artificial hip, especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions.\n\nYou will need to have someone with you at home for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehab center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.\n\nOver time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.\n\nHome Setup\nYour bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You may not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.\n\nKeep tripping hazards out of your home.\n\nLearn to prevent falls. Remove loose wires or cords from areas you walk through to get from one room to another. Remove loose throw rugs. Do not keep small pets in your home. Fix any uneven flooring in doorways. Use good lighting.\nMake your bathroom safer. Put hand rails in the bathtub or shower and next to the toilet. Place a slip-proof mat in the bathtub or shower.\nDo not carry anything when you are walking around. You may need your hands to help you balance. You can attach a pocket or holder to your walker or crutches to hold things instead.\nPut things where they are easy to reach.\n\nPlace a chair with a firm back in the kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and other rooms you will use. This way, you can sit when you do your daily tasks.\n\nSet up your home so that you do not have to climb steps. Some tips are:\n\nSet up a bed or use a bedroom on the first floor.\nHave a bathroom or a portable commode on the same floor where you spend most of your day.\nActivity\nYou will need to be careful to not dislocate your new hip when you are walking, sitting, lying down, dressing, taking a bath or shower, and doing other activities. Avoid sitting in a low chair or soft sofa.\n\nKeep moving and walking once you get home. Try not to sit for more than 45 minutes at a time. Get up and move around after 45 minutes if you will be sitting longer.\n\nDo not put your full weight on your side with the new hip until your surgeon tells you it is OK. Start out with short periods of activity, and then gradually increase them. Your surgeon or physical therapist will give you exercises to do at home.\n\nUse your crutches or walker for as long as you need them. Check with your surgeon before you stop using them.\n\nAfter a few days you may be able to do simple household chores. Do not try to do heavier chores, such as vacuuming or laundry. Remember, you will get tired quickly at first. Do not squat down to clean.\n\nWear a small fanny pack or backpack, or attach a basket or strong bag to your walker, so that you can keep small household items, like a phone and notepad, with you.\n\nWound Care\nKeep your dressing (bandage) on your wound clean and dry. You may change the dressing according to when your surgeon told you to change it. Be sure to change it if it gets dirty or wet. Follow these steps when you change your dressing:\n\nWash your hands well with soap and water.\nRemove the dressing carefully. Do not pull hard. If you need to, soak some of the dressing with sterile water or saline to help loosen it.\nSoak some clean gauze with saline and wipe from one end of the incision to the other. Do not wipe back and forth over the same area.\nDry the incision the same way with clean, dry gauze. Wipe or pat in just one direction.\nCheck your wound for signs of infection. These include severe swelling and redness and drainage that has a bad odor.\nApply a new dressing the way you were shown.\nSutures (stitches) or staples will be removed about 10 to 14 days after surgery. Do not shower until 3 to 4 days after your surgery, or when your surgeon told you to shower. When you can shower, let water run over your incision but do not scrub it or let the water beat down on it. Do not soak in a bathtub, hot tub, or swimming pool.\n\nYou may have bruising around your wound. This is normal, and it will go away on its own. The skin around your incision may be a little red. This is normal too.\n\nSelf-care\nYour surgeon will give you a prescription for pain medicines. Get it filled when you go home so you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine when you start having pain. Waiting too long to take it will allow your pain to get more severe than it should.\n\nIn the early part of your recovery, taking pain medicine about 30 minutes before you increase your activity or do your physical therapy can help control pain.\n\nYou may be asked to wear special compression stockings on your legs for about 6 weeks. These will help prevent blood clots from forming. You may also need to take blood thinners for 2 to 4 weeks to lower your risk for blood clots. Take all your medicines the way your surgeon told you to. It can make your bruise go away more easily.\n\nYour surgeon will tell you when it is OK to start sexual activity again.\n\nPeople who have a prosthesis, such as an artificial joint, need to carefully protect themselves against infection. It used to be recommended that you need to take antibiotics before any dental work or invasive medical procedures, however, the recommendation has been changed except for high risk patients. Make sure to check with your surgeon, and tell your dentist or other surgeons about your hip replacement.\n\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nContact your surgeon if you have:\n\nA sudden increase in pain\nChest pain or shortness of breath\nFrequent urination or burning when you urinate\nRedness or increasing pain around your incision\nDrainage from your incision\nBlood in your stools, or your stools turn dark\nSwelling in one of your legs (it will be red and warmer than the other leg)\nPain in your calf\nFever greater than 101°F (38.3°C)\nPain that is not controlled by your pain medicines\nNosebleeds or blood in your urine or stools if you are taking blood thinners\nAlso contact your surgeon if you:\n\nCannot move your hip as much as you could before\nFall or hurt your leg on the side that had surgery\nHave increased pain in your hip\nHave difficulty with walking and bending your hip\nFeel like your hip have slipped or out of position",
