            <div class='text-box original'>Heart Failure - Discharge

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is no longer able to pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body efficiently. When symptoms become severe, a hospital stay may be necessary. This article discusses what you need to do to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You were in the hospital to have your heart failure treated. Heart failure occurs when the muscles of your heart are weak or have trouble relaxing, or both.

Your heart is a pump that moves fluids through your body. As with any pump, if the flow out of the pump is not enough, fluids do not move well and they get stuck in places they should not be. In your body, this means that fluid collects in your lungs, abdomen, and legs.

While you were in the hospital:
Your health care team closely adjusted the fluids you drank or received through an intravenous (IV) line. They also watched and measured how much urine you produced.
You may have received medicines to help your body get rid of extra fluids.
You may have had tests to check how well your heart was working.

What to Expect at Home
Your energy will slowly return. You may need help taking care of yourself when you first get home. You may feel sad or depressed. All of these things are normal.

Checking Yourself at Home
Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale when you get up -- before you eat but after you use the bathroom. Make sure you are wearing similar clothing each time you weigh yourself. Write down your weight every day on a chart so that you can keep track of it.

Throughout the day, ask yourself:
Is my energy level normal?
Do I get more short of breath when I am doing my everyday activities?
Are my clothes or shoes feeling tight?
Are my ankles or legs swelling?
Am I coughing more often? Does my cough sound wet?
Do I get short of breath at night or when I lie down?

If you are having new (or different) symptoms, ask yourself:

Did I eat something different than usua...</div>

            <div class='text-box translated'>فشل القلب - الخروج من المستشفى

فشل القلب هو حالة لا يعود فيها القلب قادرًا على ضخ الدم الغني بالأكسجين إلى باقي الجسم بكفاءة. عندما تصبح الأعراض شديدة، قد تكون هناك حاجة للبقاء في المستشفى. تتناول هذه المقالة ما تحتاج إلى القيام به للعناية بنفسك عندما تغادر المستشفى.

عندما تكون في المستشفى  
كنت في المستشفى لعلاج فشل القلب لديك. يحدث فشل القلب عندما تكون عضلات قلبك ضعيفة أو تواجه صعوبة في الاسترخاء، أو كلاهما معًا.

قلبك عبارة عن مضخة تحرك السوائل في جسمك. وكأي مضخة أخرى، إذا لم يكن تدفق السوائل الخارج من المضخة كافيًا، فإن السوائل لا تتحرك جيدًا وتتجمع في أماكن لا ينبغي أن تكون فيها. في جسمك، يعني هذا أن السوائل تتجمع في رئتيك وبطنك وساقيك.

أثناء وجودك في المستشفى:  
قام فريق الرعاية الصحية الخاص بك بضبط كمية السوائل التي تشربها أو التي تتلقاها عبر الوريد (IV) بدقة. كما راقبوا وقاسوا كمية البول التي تخرجها.  
قد تكون قد تلقيت أدوية لمساعدة جسمك على التخلص من السوائل الزائدة.  
قد تكون أجريت لك فحوصات للتحقق من مدى كفاءة عمل قلبك.

ما يمكن توقعه في المنزل  
ستعود طاقتك تدريجيًا. قد تحتاج إلى مساعدة في العناية بنفسك عندما تعود إلى المنزل في البداية. قد تشعر بالحزن أو الاكتئاب. كل هذه الأمور طبيعية.

مراقبة نفسك في المنزل  
زن نفسك كل صباح على نفس الميزان عندما تستيقظ من النوم – قبل أن تأكل ولكن بعد استخدام الحمام. تأكد من أنك ترتدي ملابس مشابهة في كل مرة تزن فيها نفسك. دوّن وزنك كل يوم في جدول حتى تتمكن من متابعته.

خلال اليوم، اسأل نفسك:  
هل مستوى طاقتي طبيعي؟  
هل أصبح ضيق النفس لدي أكثر عندما أقوم بأنشطتي اليومية العادية؟  
هل ملابسي أو حذائي أصبحا ضيقين؟  
هل كاحلاي أو ساقاي متورمتان؟  
هل أسعل أكثر من قبل؟ هل يبدو سعالي رطبًا؟  
هل أعاني من ضيق في التنفس ليلًا أو عندما أستلقي؟

إذا كانت لديك أعراض جديدة (أو مختلفة)، اسأل نفسك:

هل أكلت شيئًا مختلفًا عن المعتاد أو جربت طعامًا جديدًا؟  
هل تناولت جميع أدويتي بالطريقة الصحيحة وفي الأوقات الصحيحة؟

النظام الغذائي والسوائل  
قد يطلب منك مقدم الرعاية الصحية أن تحد من كمية السوائل التي تشربها.

عندما لا يكون فشل القلب لديك شديدًا، قد لا تحتاج إلى تقييد السوائل كثيرًا.  
مع ازدياد شدة فشل القلب، قد يُطلب منك تقييد ا...</div>

Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told. Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines with it or at different times, and eating certain foods can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

What to Expect at Home
Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. This may be important if:

You have already had blood clots in your leg, arm, heart, or brain.
Your health care provider is worried that a blood clot may form in your body. People who have a new heart valve, a large heart, a heart rhythm that is not normal, or other heart problems may need to take warfarin.
When you are taking warfarin, you may be more likely to bleed, even from activities you have always done.

Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines, and eating certain foods all can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

Taking Warfarin

            <div class='text-box translated'>تناول الوارفارين

الوارفارين هو دواء يجعل دمك أقل عرضة لتكوين الجلطات. من المهم أن تتناول الوارفارين تمامًا كما طُلب منك. تغيير طريقة تناولك للوارفارين، أو تناول أدوية أخرى معه أو في أوقات مختلفة، أو تناول أطعمة معيّنة يمكن أن يغيّر طريقة عمل الوارفارين في جسمك. إذا حدث ذلك، قد تصبح أكثر عرضة لتكوين جلطة أو لحدوث مشاكل نزيف.

ما يمكن توقّعه في المنزل  
الوارفارين هو دواء يجعل دمك أقل عرضة لتكوين الجلطات. قد يكون هذا مهمًا إذا:

- كنت قد أصبت سابقًا بجلطات دموية في الساق أو الذراع أو القلب أو الدماغ.
- كان مقدم الرعاية الصحية قلقًا من احتمال تكوّن جلطة دموية في جسمك. الأشخاص الذين لديهم صمام قلب جديد، أو قلب متضخم، أو اضطراب في نظم القلب، أو مشاكل قلبية أخرى قد يحتاجون لتناول الوارفارين.

عندما تتناول الوارفارين، قد تصبح أكثر عرضة للنزيف، حتى من أنشطة كنت تقوم بها دائمًا.

تغيير طريقة تناولك للوارفارين، أو تناول أدوية أخرى، أو تناول أطعمة معيّنة، كل ذلك يمكن أن يغيّر طريقة عمل الوارفارين في جسمك. إذا حدث ذلك، قد تصبح أكثر عرضة لتكوين جلطة أو لحدوث مشاكل نزيف.

تناول الوارفارين  
من المهم أن تتناول الوارفارين تمامًا كما طُلب منك.

- تناول فقط الجرعة التي وصفها لك مقدم الرعاية. إذا نسيت جرعة، تواصل مع مقدم الرعاية للحصول على نصيحة.
- إذا بدت الحبوب مختلفة عن وصفة الدواء السابقة، تواصل مع مقدم الرعاية أو الصيدلي فورًا. الأقراص لها ألوان مختلفة حسب الجرعة. الجرعة مكتوبة أيضًا على الحبة.
- سيقوم مقدم الرعاية بإجراء فحوصات دم منتظمة لك. يُسمّى هذا فحص INR أو أحيانًا فحص PT. يساعد الفحص في التأكد من أنك تتناول الكمية الصحيحة من الوارفارين لمساعدة جسمك.

الكحول وبعض الأدوية يمكن أن تغيّر طريقة عمل الوارفارين في جسمك.

- لا تتناول الكحول أثناء تناولك للوارفارين.
- تحدّث مع مقدم الرعاية قبل تناول أي أدوية أخرى تُصرف بدون وصفة، أو فيتامينات، أو مكملات غذائية، أو أدوية للبرد، أو مضادات حيوية، أو أدوية أخرى.
- أخبر جميع مقدمي الرعاية الصحية أنك تتناول الوارفارين. يشمل ذلك الأطباء والممرضين وطبيب الأسنان. أحيانًا قد تحتاج إلى إيقاف الوارفارين أو تقليل الجرعة قبل إجراء عملية أو إجراء طبي. دائمًا تحدّث مع مقدم الرعاية الذي وصف لك الوارفارين قبل إيقافه أو تغيير جرعتك.

تحدث النوبة القلبية عندما ينقطع تدفق الدم إلى جزء من قلبك لمدة كافية بحيث يتضرر جزء من عضلة القلب أو يموت. تتناول هذه المقالة ما تحتاج إلى القيام به للعناية بنفسك بعد مغادرة المستشفى.

عندما تكون في المستشفى
كنت في المستشفى لأنك أصبت بنوبة قلبية. تحدث النوبة القلبية عندما ينقطع تدفق الدم إلى جزء من قلبك لمدة كافية بحيث يتضرر جزء من عضلة القلب أو يموت.

ما يمكن توقعه في المنزل
قد تشعر بالحزن. قد تشعر بالقلق وكأن عليك أن تكون حذرًا جدًا فيما تفعله. كل هذه المشاعر طبيعية. تختفي عند معظم الناس بعد 2 أو 3 أسابيع. قد تشعر أيضًا بالتعب عندما تغادر المستشفى وتعود إلى المنزل.

النشاط
يجب أن تعرف علامات وأعراض الذبحة الصدرية.

قد تشعر بضغط أو عصر أو حرقان أو ضيق في صدرك. قد تلاحظ هذه الأعراض أيضًا في ذراعيك أو كتفيك أو رقبتك أو فكك أو حلقك أو ظهرك.
بعض الناس يشعرون أيضًا بعدم الراحة في الظهر والكتفين ومنطقة المعدة.
قد تصاب بعسر هضم أو تشعر بالغثيان.
قد تشعر بالتعب وضيق النفس أو التعرق أو الدوخة أو الضعف.
قد تصاب بالذبحة الصدرية أثناء النشاط البدني، مثل صعود الدرج أو المشي صعودًا، أو رفع الأشياء، أو النشاط الجنسي، أو عندما تكون في طقس بارد. يمكن أن تحدث أيضًا عندما تكون في حالة راحة أو قد توقظك من النوم.
اعرف كيفية علاج ألم الصدر عندما يحدث. تحدث مع مقدم الرعاية الصحية الخاص بك حول ما يجب القيام به.

تجنب رفع الأشياء الثقيلة. اطلب المساعدة في أعمال المنزل إن أمكن.
خذ 30 إلى 60 دقيقة للراحة بعد الظهر خلال أول 4 إلى 6 أسابيع. حاول أن تذهب إلى السرير مبكرًا وأن تحصل على قسط كافٍ من النوم.
قبل البدء في ممارسة الرياضة، قد يطلب منك مقدم الرعاية الصحية إجراء اختبار جهد ويضع لك خطة للتمارين. قد يحدث هذا قبل مغادرتك المستشفى أو بعد ذلك بوقت قصير. لا تغيّر خطة التمارين قبل التحدث مع مقدم الرعاية الصحية.
قد يحوّلك مقدم الرعاية الصحية إلى برنامج إعادة تأهيل قلبي. هناك، ستتعلم كيف تزيد التمارين تدريجيًا وكيف تعتني بمرض القلب لديك.
إذا أجريت لك قسطرة تشخيصية (angiography)، فاتبع تعليمات مقدم الرعاية الصحية للعناية بمكان الوخز.
يجب أن تكون قادرًا على التحدث براحة أثناء قيامك بأي نشاط، مثل المشي أو ترتيب المائد...</div>

When your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the pressure of the blood against the artery walls is called your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is given as two numbers: systolic over diastolic blood pressure. Your systolic blood pressure is the highest blood pressure during the course of your heart beat cycle. Your diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure.

When your blood pressure gets too high, it puts extra stress on your heart and blood vessels. If your blood pressure stays high all the time, you will be at a higher risk for heart attacks and other vascular (blood vessel) diseases, strokes, kidney disease, and other health problems.

Below are questions you may want to ask your health care provider to help you take care of your blood pressure.

Questions
How can I change the way I live to lower my blood pressure?

What is a heart-healthy diet? Is it OK to ever eat something that is not heart healthy? What are some ways to eat healthy when I go to a restaurant?
Do I need to limit how much salt I use? Are there other spices that I can use to make my food taste good?
Is it OK to drink alcohol? How much is OK?

عندما يضخ قلبك الدم إلى الشرايين، يُسمّى ضغط الدم على جدران الشرايين ضغط الدم لديك. يُعطى ضغط الدم لديك كرقمين: الضغط الانقباضي فوق الضغط الانبساطي. الضغط الانقباضي هو أعلى ضغط دم خلال دورة نبضات القلب. الضغط الانبساطي هو أقل ضغط.

عندما يرتفع ضغط الدم كثيرًا، فإنه يضع ضغطًا إضافيًا على قلبك وأوعيتك الدموية. إذا بقي ضغط دمك مرتفعًا طوال الوقت، ستكون أكثر عرضة للإصابة بالنوبات القلبية وأمراض الأوعية الدموية الأخرى، والسكتات الدماغية، وأمراض الكلى، ومشكلات صحية أخرى.

فيما يلي أسئلة قد ترغب في طرحها على مقدم الرعاية الصحية لمساعدتك على العناية بضغط دمك.

            <div class='text-box translated'>**ارتفاع ضغط الدم - ما يجب أن تسأله لطبيبك**

عندما يضخ قلبك الدم إلى الشرايين، يُسمى ضغط الدم على جدران الشرايين بضغط الدم. يتم التعبير عن ضغط الدم برقمين: ضغط الدم الانقباضي على ضغط الدم الانبساطي. ضغط الدم الانقباضي هو أعلى ضغط للدم خلال دورة نبضات قلبك. ضغط الدم الانبساطي هو أقل ضغط.

عندما يرتفع ضغط دمك كثيراً، فإنه يضع جهداً إضافياً على قلبك وأوعيتك الدموية. إذا بقي ضغط دمك مرتفعاً طوال الوقت، ستكون أكثر عرضة لخطر الإصابة بالنوبات القلبية وأمراض الأوعية الدموية الأخرى، والسكتات الدماغية، وأمراض الكلى، ومشاكل صحية أخرى.

فيما يلي أسئلة قد ترغب في طرحها على مقدم الرعاية الصحية لمساعدتك في العناية بضغط دمك.

**أسئلة**

**كيف يمكنني تغيير نمط حياتي لخفض ضغط دمي؟**

*   ما هو النظام الغذائي الصحي للقلب؟ هل لا بأس بتناول شيء غير صحي للقلب في بعض الأحيان؟ ما هي بعض الطرق لتناول طعام صحي عندما أذهب إلى مطعم؟
*   هل أحتاج إلى الحد من كمية الملح التي أستخدمها؟ هل هناك توابل أخرى يمكنني استخدامها لجعل طعامي لذيذ المذاق؟
*   هل يُسمح بشرب الكحول؟ ما هي الكمية المسموح بها؟
*   ماذا يمكنني أن أفعل للإقلاع عن التدخين؟ هل لا بأس بالتواجد حول أشخاص آخرين يدخنون؟

**هل يجب أن أقيس ضغط دمي في المنزل؟**

*   ما نوع الجهاز الذي يجب أن أشتريه؟ وأين يمكنني تعلم كيفية استخدامه؟
*   كم مرة أحتاج إلى قياس ضغط دمي؟ هل يجب أن أدونه وأحضره معي في زيارتي القادمة؟
*   إذا لم أتمكن من قياس ضغط دمي بنفسي، فأين يمكنني قياسه؟
*   كم يجب أن تكون قراءة ضغط دمي؟ هل يجب أن أرتاح قبل قياس ضغط الدم؟
*   متى يجب أن أتصل بمقدم الرعاية الصحية؟
*   ما هو مستوى الكوليسترول لدي؟ هل أحتاج لتناول أدوية لعلاجه؟

**هل لا بأس بممارسة النشاط الجنسي؟ هل من الآمن استخدام سيلدينافيل (فياجرا)، أو تادالافيل (سياليس)، أو فاردنافيل (ستاكسين)، أو أفانافيل (ستيندرا) لمشاكل الانتصاب؟**

**ما هي الأدوية التي أتناولها لعلاج ارتفاع ضغط الدم؟**

*   هل لها أي آثار جانبية؟ ماذا يجب أن أفعل إذا نسيت جرعة؟
*   هل من الآمن في أي وقت التوقف عن تناول أي من هذه الأدوية من تلقاء نفسي؟

**ما مقدار النشاط الذي يمكنني القيام به؟**

*   هل أحتاج لإجراء اختبار إجهاد القلب قبل ممارسة الرياضة؟

When your heart pumps blood to the arteries, the pressure of the blood on the walls of the arteries is called blood pressure. Blood pressure is expressed by two numbers: systolic blood pressure over diastolic blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure is the highest pressure of the blood during the cycle of your heartbeats. Diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure.

When your blood pressure rises a lot, it puts extra effort on your heart and blood vessels. If your blood pressure remains high all the time, you will be at higher risk of having heart attacks and other vascular diseases, strokes, kidney diseases, and other health problems.

Below are questions you may wish to ask the health care provider to help you in caring for your blood pressure.

**Questions**

**How can I change my lifestyle to lower my blood pressure?**

*   What is a heart-healthy diet? Is it okay to eat something not heart-healthy sometimes? What are some ways to eat healthy food when I go to a restaurant?
*   Do I need to limit the amount of salt I use? Are there other spices I can use to make my food taste delicious?
*   Is drinking alcohol allowed? What is the allowed amount?
*   What can I do to quit smoking? Is it okay to be around other people who smoke?

**Should I measure my blood pressure at home?**

*   What type of device should I buy? And where can I learn how to use it?
*   How often do I need to measure my blood pressure? Should I write it down and bring it with me on my next visit?
*   If I cannot measure my blood pressure myself, where can I measure it?
*   How much should my blood pressure reading be? Should I rest before measuring blood pressure?
*   When should I contact the health care provider?
*   What is my cholesterol level? Do I need to take medicines to treat it?

Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.

What is Low Blood Sugar?
Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.

You are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:

Recognizing Low Blood Sugar
Know how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:

Weakness or feeling tired
Shaking
Sweating
Headache
Hunger
Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious
Feeling cranky
Trouble thinking clearly

Fast or pounding heartbeat
Sometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:

Faint
Have a seizure
Go into a coma
Some people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.

Check Your Blood Sugar Often
Talk with your provider about when you should check your blood sugar every day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.

The most common causes of low blood sugar are:

Taking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time
Taking too much insul...</div>

انخفاض سكر الدم هو حالة تحدث عندما يكون مستوى سكر الدم (الغلوكوز) أقل من المعدل الطبيعي. قد يحدث انخفاض سكر الدم عند الأشخاص المصابين بالسكري الذين يتناولون الإنسولين أو بعض الأدوية الأخرى للتحكم في السكري. يمكن أن يسبب انخفاض سكر الدم أعراضًا خطيرة. تعلّم كيف تتعرف على أعراض انخفاض سكر الدم وكيف تمنع حدوثها.

ما هو انخفاض سكر الدم؟
يُسمّى انخفاض سكر الدم بـ "نقص سكر الدم" (Hypoglycemia). مستوى سكر الدم الأقل من 70 ملغ/دل (3.9 مليمول/لتر) يُعد منخفضًا ويمكن أن يضرّك. مستوى سكر الدم الأقل من 54 ملغ/دل (3.0 مليمول/لتر) يستدعي اتخاذ إجراء فوري.

تكون معرضًا لخطر انخفاض سكر الدم إذا كنت مصابًا بالسكري وتتناول أيًا من أدوية السكري التالية:

الإنسولين  
غليبوريد (Micronase)، غليبيزايد (Glucotrol)، غليميبرايد (Amaryl)، ريباغلينيد (Prandin)، أو ناتيغلينيد (Starlix)  
كما أنك تكون أكثر عرضة للإصابة بانخفاض سكر الدم إذا سبق أن تعرضت لنوبات انخفاض في سكر الدم من قبل.

التعرف على انخفاض سكر الدم
اعرف كيف تميّز عندما يبدأ سكر دمك بالانخفاض. تشمل الأعراض:

ضعف أو شعور بالتعب  
رجفة  
تعرّق  
صداع  
جوع  
شعور بعدم الارتياح أو التوتر أو القلق  
شعور بالعصبية أو الانزعاج  
صعوبة في التفكير بوضوح  
رؤية مزدوجة أو ضبابية  
سرعة أو خفقان في ضربات القلب  

أحيانًا قد يكون سكر دمك منخفضًا جدًا حتى لو لم تكن لديك أعراض. إذا انخفض كثيرًا، قد:

تفقد الوعي  
تُصاب بنوبة (اختلاج)  
تدخل في غيبوبة  

بعض الأشخاص الذين يعانون من السكري منذ فترة طويلة قد يفقدون القدرة على الإحساس بانخفاض سكر الدم. يُسمّى هذا "عدم الإحساس بنقص سكر الدم" (Hypoglycemic unawareness). اسأل مقدم الرعاية الصحية لديك ما إذا كان ارتداء جهاز مراقبة الغلوكوز المستمر (Continuous Glucose Monitor) مع حساس يمكن أن يساعدك على اكتشاف انخفاض سكر الدم قبل ظهور الأعراض للمساعدة في منعها.

افحص سكر دمك كثيرًا
تحدث مع مقدم الرعاية الصحية لديك عن عدد المرات التي يجب أن تفحص فيها سكر دمك كل يوم. الأشخاص الذين يعانون من انخفاض سكر الدم يحتاجون إلى فحص سكر الدم لديهم مرات أكثر.

أكثر الأسباب شيوعًا لانخفاض سكر الدم هي:

تناول الإنسولين أو دواء السكري في وقت غير مناسب  
تناول كمية كبيرة من الإنسولين أو ...</div>

Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when the level of blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who take insulin or some other medicines to control diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause serious symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent it.

What is low blood sugar?  
Low blood sugar is called “hypoglycemia.” A blood sugar level lower than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is considered low and can harm you. A blood sugar level lower than 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) requires taking immediate action.

You are at risk of low blood sugar if you have diabetes and take any of the following diabetes medicines:

Insulin  
Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)  
You are also more likely to develop low blood sugar if you have had episodes of low blood sugar before.

Recognizing low blood sugar  
Know how to recognize when your blood sugar starts to drop. Symptoms include:

Weakness or feeling tired  
Shaking  
Sweating  
Headache  
Hunger  
Feeling uncomfortable or tense or anxious  
Feeling nervous or irritable  
Difficulty thinking clearly  
Double or blurry vision  
Fast or pounding heartbeat  

Sometimes your blood sugar may be very low even if you do not have symptoms. If it drops too much, you may:

Lose consciousness  
Have a seizure (convulsion)  
Go into a coma  

Some people who have had diabetes for a long time may lose the ability to feel low blood sugar. This is called “hypoglycemic unawareness.” Ask your health care provider whether wearing a Continuous Glucose Monitor with a sensor can help you detect low blood sugar before symptoms appear to help prevent it.

Asthma quick-relief medicines work fast to control asthma symptoms. You take them when you are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack. They are also called rescue medicines.

Many of these medicines are called "bronchodilators" because they open (dilate) and help relax the muscles of your airways (bronchi).

You and your health care provider can make a plan for the quick-relief medicines that work for you. This plan will include when you should take them and how much you should take.

Plan ahead. Make sure you do not run out. Bring enough medicine with you when you travel.

Short-acting Beta-agonists
Short-acting beta-agonists are the most common quick-relief medicines for treating asthma attacks and are considered to be bronchodilators.

They can be used just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise. They work by relaxing the muscles of your airways, and this lets you breathe better during an attack.

Tell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more to control your asthma symptoms. Your asthma may not be under control, and your provider may need to change your dose of daily control medicines.

Some quick-relief asthma medicines include:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline
Short-acting beta-agonists may cause these side effects:

Anxiety.
Fast and irregular heartbeats. Call your provider right away if you have this side effect.
Headache.
Restlessness.
Tremor (your hand or another part of your body may shake).
Oral Steroids
Your provider might prescribe oral steroids when you have an asthma attack that is not going away. These are medicines that you take by mouth as pills, capsules, or liquids.

Oral steroids are not quick-relief medicines but are often given for 7 to 14 days when your symptoms flare-up.

Oral steroids include:

Methylprednisolone
Prednisone

أدوية الإغاثة السريعة للربو تعمل بسرعة للسيطرة على أعراض الربو. تأخذها عندما تسعل، أو تصدر صفيرًا في الصدر، أو تواجه صعوبة في التنفس، أو عندما تتعرض لنوبة ربو. تُسمّى أيضًا أدوية الإنقاذ.

يُطلق على العديد من هذه الأدوية اسم "موسّعات القصبات" لأنها تفتح (تُوسِّع) وتساعد على إرخاء عضلات مجاري الهواء لديك (القصبات الهوائية).

يمكنك أنت ومقدّم الرعاية الصحية وضع خطة لأدوية الإغاثة السريعة التي تناسبك. ستتضمّن هذه الخطة متى يجب أن تأخذها وكمية الجرعة التي يجب أن تأخذها.

خطّط مسبقًا. تأكّد من أنك لا تنفد من الدواء. أحضر معك كمية كافية من الدواء عندما تسافر.

ناهضات بيتا قصيرة المفعول
ناهضات بيتا قصيرة المفعول هي أكثر أدوية الإغاثة السريعة شيوعًا لعلاج نوبات الربو، وتُعتبَر من موسّعات القصبات.

يمكن استخدامها قبل ممارسة التمارين الرياضية مباشرة للمساعدة في منع أعراض الربو الناتجة عن التمرين. تعمل عن طريق إرخاء عضلات مجاري الهواء لديك، وهذا يسمح لك بالتنفس بشكل أفضل أثناء النوبة.

أخبر مقدّم الرعاية الصحية إذا كنت تستخدم أدوية الإغاثة السريعة مرتين في الأسبوع أو أكثر للسيطرة على أعراض الربو لديك. قد لا يكون الربو تحت السيطرة، وقد يحتاج مقدّم الرعاية الصحية إلى تغيير جرعة أدوية التحكم اليومية.

بعض أدوية الإغاثة السريعة للربو تشمل:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline
قد تسبّب ناهضات بيتا قصيرة المفعول هذه الآثار الجانبية:

القلق.
سرعة وعدم انتظام ضربات القلب. اتصل بمقدّم الرعاية الصحية على الفور إذا حدث لك هذا الأثر الجانبي.
الصداع.
الأرق أو صعوبة في الهدوء.
الرعشة (قد ترتجف يدك أو جزء آخر من جسمك).
الستيرويدات الفموية
قد يصف لك مقدّم الرعاية الصحية الستيرويدات الفموية عندما تتعرض لنوبة ربو لا تتحسن. هذه أدوية تأخذها عن طريق الفم على شكل حبوب أو كبسولات أو سوائل.

الستيرويدات الفموية ليست أدوية إغاثة سريعة، لكنها غالبًا تُعطى لمدة من 7 إلى 14 يومًا عندما تشتد الأعراض.

تشمل الستيرويدات الفموية:

            <div class='text-box original'>Asthma - quick-relief drugs

Asthma quick-relief medicines work fast to control asthma symptoms. You take them when you are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack. They are also called rescue medicines.

Many of these medicines are called "bronchodilators" because they open (dilate) and help relax the muscles of your airways (bronchi).

You and your health care provider can make a plan for the quick-relief medicines that work for you. This plan will include when you should take them and how much you should take.

Plan ahead. Make sure you do not run out. Bring enough medicine with you when you travel.

Short-acting Beta-agonists
Short-acting beta-agonists are the most common quick-relief medicines for treating asthma attacks and are considered to be bronchodilators.

They can be used just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise. They work by relaxing the muscles of your airways, and this lets you breathe better during an attack.

Tell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more to control your asthma symptoms. Your asthma may not be under control, and your provider may need to change your dose of daily control medicines.

Some quick-relief asthma medicines include:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline
Short-acting beta-agonists may cause these side effects:

Anxiety.
Fast and irregular heartbeats. Call your provider right away if you have this side effect.
Headache.
Restlessness.
Tremor (your hand or another part of your body may shake).
Oral Steroids
Your provider might prescribe oral steroids when you have an asthma attack that is not going away. These are medicines that you take by mouth as pills, capsules, or liquids.

Oral steroids are not quick-relief medicines but are often given for 7 to 14 days when your symptoms flare-up.

Oral steroids include:

Methylprednisolone
Prednisone
Prednisolone</div>

تُسمى العديد من هذه الأدوية "موسعات الشعب الهوائية" لأنها تفتح (توسّع) وتساعد على إرخاء عضلات مجاري الهواء لديك (القصبات الهوائية).

يمكنك أنت ومقدم الرعاية الصحية الخاص بك وضع خطة لأدوية الإغاثة السريعة المناسبة لك. ستتضمن هذه الخطة متى يجب أن تتناولها وكم يجب أن تتناول منها.

خطط مسبقاً. تأكد من عدم نفاد الدواء لديك. أحضر معك كمية كافية من الدواء عند السفر.

ناهضات بيتا قصيرة المفعول
ناهضات بيتا قصيرة المفعول هي أكثر أدوية الإغاثة السريعة شيوعاً لعلاج نوبات الربو وتُعتبر من موسعات الشعب الهوائية.

يمكن استخدامها قبل ممارسة التمارين الرياضية مباشرة للمساعدة في منع أعراض الربو الناتجة عن التمارين. تعمل عن طريق إرخاء عضلات مجاري الهواء لديك، وهذا يتيح لك التنفس بشكل أفضل أثناء النوبة.

أخبر مقدم الرعاية الصحية الخاص بك إذا كنت تستخدم أدوية الإغاثة السريعة مرتين في الأسبوع أو أكثر للسيطرة على أعراض الربو لديك. قد لا يكون الربو لديك تحت السيطرة، وقد يحتاج مقدم الرعاية الصحية إلى تغيير جرعتك من أدوية السيطرة اليومية.

تشمل بعض أدوية الربو سريعة المفعول:

ألبوتيرول (ProAir HFA، Proventil HFA، Ventolin HFA)
ليفالبوتيرول (Xopenex HFA)
ميتابروتيرينول
تيربوتالين
قد تسبب ناهضات بيتا قصيرة المفعول هذه الآثار الجانبية:

القلق.
نبضات قلب سريعة وغير منتظمة. اتصل بمقدم الرعاية الصحية الخاص بك فوراً إذا ظهر لديك هذا العرض الجانبي.
صداع.

كنت في المستشفى بعد إصابتك بسكتة دماغية. تحدث السكتة الدماغية عندما يتوقف تدفق الدم إلى جزء من الدماغ.

في المنزل، اتبع تعليمات مقدم الرعاية الصحية حول العناية الذاتية. استخدم المعلومات أدناه كتذكير.

عندما تكون في المستشفى  
أولاً، تلقيت علاجًا لمنع حدوث ضرر إضافي للدماغ، ولمساعدة القلب والرئتين والأعضاء المهمة الأخرى على التعافي.

بعد أن أصبحت حالتك مستقرة، قام مقدمو الرعاية بإجراء فحوصات وبدأوا العلاج لمساعدتك على التعافي من السكتة الدماغية ومنع حدوث سكتة دماغية أخرى في المستقبل. قد تكون مكثت في وحدة خاصة تساعد الأشخاص على التعافي بعد السكتة الدماغية.

ما يمكن توقعه في المنزل  
بسبب احتمال حدوث إصابة في الدماغ نتيجة السكتة الدماغية، قد تلاحظ مشكلات في:

- تغيّرات في السلوك  
- القيام بالمهام السهلة  
- الذاكرة  
- تحريك أحد جانبي الجسم  
- تشنجات العضلات  
- الانتباه  
- الإحساس أو الوعي بجزء من الجسم  
- البلع  
- التحدث أو فهم الآخرين  
- التفكير  
- الرؤية في جهة واحدة (نصف عمى بصري - hemianopsia)

قد تحتاج إلى مساعدة في الأنشطة اليومية التي كنت تقوم بها وحدك قبل السكتة الدماغية. قد تحصل على علاج طبيعي أو علاج وظيفي لاستعادة قدرتك على القيام بهذه الوظائف.

الاكتئاب بعد السكتة الدماغية أمر شائع إلى حد ما، بينما تتعلم التعايش مع التغييرات. قد يظهر الاكتئاب بعد السكتة الدماغية مباشرة أو حتى بعد مرور سنتين على السكتة.

لا تقد سيارتك بدون إذن من مقدم الرعاية الصحية.

الحركة والتنقل  
قد يكون التحرك والقيام بالمهام العادية صعبًا بعد السكتة الدماغية.

تأكد من أن منزلك آمن. اسأل مقدم الرعاية أو المعالج أو الممرضة عن التغييرات التي يمكن إجراؤها في المنزل لتسهيل القيام بالأنشطة اليومية.

تعرّف إلى ما يمكنك فعله لمنع السقوط وجعل الحمام آمنًا للاستخدام.

قد تحتاج الأسرة ومقدمو الرعاية إلى المساعدة في:

- تمارين للحفاظ على ليونة المرفقين والكتفين والمفاصل الأخرى  
- مراقبة تيبّس المفاصل (التقلصات - contractures)  
- التأكد من استخدام الجبائر بالطريقة الصحيحة  
- التأكد من أن الذراعين والساقين في وضعية جيدة عند الجلوس أو الاستلقاء

            <div class='text-box original'>Surgical wound care - open

An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the kind of surgery you had.

Sometimes, an incision breaks open. This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).

What to Expect at Home
If your surgeon does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. A dressing helps absorb drainage and keep the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.

Proper Handwashing
It is important to clean your hands before you change your dressing. You can use an alcohol-based cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands using these steps:

Take all jewelry off your hands.
Wet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.
Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or the "Alphabet Song" one time through). Clean under your nails also.
Rinse well.
Dry with a clean towel.
Removing the Old Dressing
Your health care provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. To prepare for the dressing change:

Clean your hands before touching the dressing.
Make sure you have all the supplies handy.
Have a clean work surface.
Remove the old dressing:

Carefully loosen the tape from your skin.
Use a clean (not sterile) medical glove to grab the old dressing and pull it off.
If the dressing sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your provider instructed you to pull it off dry.
Put the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.
Clean your hands again after you take off the old dressing.
Caring for the Wound
You may use a gauze pad or soft cloth to clean the skin around your wound:

Use a normal saline solution (salt water) or mild soapy water.
Soak the gauze or cloth in the saline solutio...</div>

            <div class='text-box translated'>العناية بالجرح الجراحي - المفتوح

الشق الجراحي هو قطع في الجلد يتم عمله أثناء الجراحة. ويُسمى أيضًا الجرح الجراحي. بعض الشقوق صغيرة، وأخرى طويلة. يعتمد حجم الشق على نوع العملية الجراحية التي خضعت لها.

أحيانًا ينفتح الشق. قد يحدث هذا على طول كامل القطع أو في جزء منه فقط. قد يقرر الجرّاح عدم إغلاقه مرة أخرى بالغُرَز (الغُرَز الجراحية).

ما يمكن توقعه في المنزل  
إذا لم يُغلق الجرّاح الجرح مرة أخرى بالغُرَز، فستحتاج إلى العناية به في المنزل، لأن التئامه قد يستغرق وقتًا. سيلتئم الجرح من الأسفل إلى الأعلى. يساعد الضماد على امتصاص الإفرازات ويمنع الجلد من الإغلاق قبل أن يمتلئ الجرح من الداخل.

غسل اليدين بشكل صحيح  
من المهم تنظيف يديك قبل تغيير الضماد. يمكنك استخدام مطهّر كحولي لليدين. أو يمكنك غسل يديك باتباع الخطوات التالية:

- انزع كل المجوهرات من يديك.
- بلّل يديك، مع توجيههما إلى الأسفل تحت ماء جارٍ دافئ.
- أضف الصابون واغسل يديك لمدة 15 إلى 30 ثانية (غنِّ أغنية "عيد ميلاد سعيد" أو "أغنية الحروف الأبجدية" مرة واحدة كاملة). نظّف تحت أظافرك أيضًا.
- اشطف يديك جيدًا.
- جففهما بمنشفة نظيفة.

إزالة الضماد القديم  
سيخبرك مقدم الرعاية الصحية بعدد المرات التي يجب أن تغيّر فيها الضماد. للتحضير لتغيير الضماد:

- نظّف يديك قبل لمس الضماد.
- تأكد من أن جميع المستلزمات في متناول يدك.
- جهّز سطح عمل نظيفًا.

إزالة الضماد القديم:

- فك الشريط اللاصق عن جلدك برفق.
- استخدم قفازًا طبيًا نظيفًا (غير معقم) للإمساك بالضماد القديم ونزعه.
- إذا التصق الضماد بالجرح، بلّله وحاول مرة أخرى، إلا إذا طلب منك مقدم الرعاية أن تنزعه وهو جاف.
- ضع الضماد القديم في كيس بلاستيكي وضعه جانبًا.
- نظّف يديك مرة أخرى بعد إزالة الضماد القديم.

العناية بالجرح  
يمكنك استخدام شاش معقم أو قطعة قماش ناعمة لتنظيف الجلد حول الجرح:

- استخدم محلول ملحي عادي (ماء وملح) أو ماءً مع صابون لطيف.
- انقع الشاش أو القماش في المحلول الملحي أو الماء والصابون، ثم ربّت أو امسح الجلد برفق.
- حاول إزالة كل الإفرازات وأي دم جاف أو مواد أخرى قد تكون تراكمت على الجلد.
- لا تستخدم منظفات الجلد، أو الكحول، أو بيروكسيد الهيدروجين، أو اليود، أو الصابون الذي يحتوي على مواد مضادة للبكتيريا. هذه المواد يمكن أن تضر بأنسجة الجرح وتبطئ ...</div>

The surgical incision is a cut in the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called the surgical wound. Some incisions are small, and others are long. The size of the incision depends on the type of surgery you had.

Sometimes the incision opens. This may happen along the entire length of the cut or only in part of it. The surgeon may decide not to close it again with stitches (surgical stitches).

What to expect at home  
If the surgeon does not close the wound again with stitches, you will need to care for it at home, because its healing may take time. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. The dressing helps absorb the drainage and prevents the skin from closing before the wound is filled in from the inside.

Proper handwashing  
It is important to clean your hands before changing the dressing. You can use an alcohol hand sanitizer. Or you can wash your hands by following these steps:

- Remove all jewelry from your hands.
- Wet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.
- Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing the “Happy Birthday” song or the “Alphabet Song” one full time). Clean under your nails as well.
- Rinse your hands well.
- Dry them with a clean towel.

Removing the old dressing  
Your health care provider will tell you how often you should change the dressing. To prepare for changing the dressing:

- Clean your hands before touching the dressing.
- Make sure all supplies are within reach.
- Prepare a clean work surface.

Removing the old dressing:

- Gently loosen the adhesive tape from your skin.
- Use a clean (non-sterile) medical glove to hold and remove the old dressing.
- If the dressing sticks to the wound, moisten it and try again, unless your provider has asked you to remove it dry.
- Put the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.

An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the kind of surgery you had.

Sometimes, an incision breaks open. This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).

What to Expect at Home
If your surgeon does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. A dressing helps absorb drainage and keep the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.

Proper Handwashing
It is important to clean your hands before you change your dressing. You can use an alcohol-based cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands using these steps:

Take all jewelry off your hands.
Wet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.
Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or the "Alphabet Song" one time through). Clean under your nails also.
Rinse well.
Dry with a clean towel.
Removing the Old Dressing
Your health care provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. To prepare for the dressing change:

Clean your hands before touching the dressing.
Make sure you have all the supplies handy.
Have a clean work surface.
Remove the old dressing:

Carefully loosen the tape from your skin.
Use a clean (not sterile) medical glove to grab the old dressing and pull it off.
If the dressing sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your provider instructed you to pull it off dry.
Put the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.
Clean your hands again after you take off the old dressing.
Caring for the Wound
You may use a gauze pad or soft cloth to clean the skin around your wound:

Use a normal saline solution (salt water) or mild soapy water.
Soak the gauze or cloth in the saline solutio...</div>

الشق هو قطع عبر الجلد يتم إجراؤه أثناء الجراحة. ويُسمى أيضاً الجرح الجراحي. بعض الشقوق صغيرة، وبعضها الآخر طويل. يعتمد حجم الشق على نوع الجراحة التي أُجريت لك.

في بعض الأحيان، ينفتح الشق. قد يحدث هذا على طول القطع بالكامل أو في جزء منه فقط. قد يقرر الجراح عدم إغلاقه مرة أخرى بالغُرز (القطب).

ماذا تتوقع في المنزل
إذا لم يقم الجراح بإغلاق جرحك مرة أخرى بالغُرز، فأنت بحاجة إلى العناية به في المنزل، حيث قد يستغرق وقتاً للشفاء. سيلتئم الجرح من الأسفل إلى الأعلى. تساعد الضمادة على امتصاص الإفرازات ومنع الجلد من الانغلاق قبل أن يمتلئ الجرح من الداخل.

غسل اليدين الصحيح
من المهم تنظيف يديك قبل تغيير الضمادة. يمكنك استخدام مُطهر كحولي. أو يمكنك غسل يديك باتباع هذه الخطوات:

انزع جميع المجوهرات من يديك.
بلل يديك، مع توجيههما للأسفل تحت الماء الجاري الدافئ.
أضف الصابون واغسل يديك لمدة 15 إلى 30 ثانية (غنِّ أغنية "عيد ميلاد سعيد" أو "أغنية الحروف الأبجدية" مرة واحدة كاملة). نظّف تحت أظافرك أيضاً.
اشطف جيداً.
جفف بمنشفة نظيفة.

إزالة الضمادة القديمة
سيخبرك مقدم الرعاية الصحية بعدد المرات التي يجب فيها تغيير الضمادة. للتحضير لتغيير الضمادة:

نظّف يديك قبل لمس الضمادة.
تأكد من أن جميع المستلزمات في متناول اليد.
احرص على وجود سطح عمل نظيف.

إزالة الضمادة القديمة:

قم بفك الشريط اللاصق بعناية عن جلدك.
استخدم قفازاً طبياً نظيفاً (ليس معقماً) للإمساك بالضمادة القديمة وسحبها.
إذا التصقت الضمادة بالجرح، بللها وحاول مرة أخرى، ما لم يُرشدك مقدم الرعاية الصحية إلى سحبها جافة.
ضع الضمادة القديمة في كيس بلاستيكي وضعها جانباً.
نظّف يديك مرة أخرى بعد إزالة الضمادة القديمة.

العناية بالجرح
يمكنك استخدام قطعة شاش أو قماش ناعم لتنظيف الجلد حول جرحك:

استخدم محلول ملحي عادي (ماء مملح) أو ماء بصابون خفيف.
انقع الشاش أو القماش في المحلول الملحي أو الماء الصابوني، واربت أو امسح الجلد برفق.
حاول إزالة جميع الإفرازات وأي دم جاف أو مواد أخرى قد تكون تراكمت على الجلد.
لا تستخدم منظفات الجلد، أو الكحول، أو بيروكسيد الهيدروجين، أو اليود، أو الصابون الذي يحتوي على مواد كيميائية مضادة للبكتيريا. فهذه يمكن أن تُتلف أنسجة الجرح وتُبطئ الشفاء.

You had surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint called a prosthesis. This article tells you what you need to do to care for your new hip when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You had a hip joint replacement surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.

What to Expect at Home
By the time you go home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without needing much help. Most people do not need them after 2 to 4 weeks. Check with your surgeon about when to stop using crutches.

You should also be able to dress yourself with only a little help and be able to get into and out of your bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help.

You will need to be careful that you do not dislocate your artificial hip, especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions.

You will need to have someone with you at home for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehab center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.

Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.

Home Setup
Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You may not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.

Keep tripping hazards out of your home.

لقد خضعتَ لعملية جراحية لاستبدال كل أو جزء من مفصل الورك بمفصل صناعي يسمى "طرف صناعي" (Prosthesis). يوضح لك هذا المقال ما تحتاج إلى فعله للعناية بمفصل الورك الجديد بعد مغادرتك المستشفى.

عندما تكون في المستشفى  
لقد خضعتَ لعملية استبدال مفصل الورك لاستبدال كل أو جزء من مفصل الورك بمفصل صناعي. هذا المفصل الصناعي يسمى طرفًا صناعيًا (Prosthesis).

ما يمكن توقعه في المنزل  
عند عودتك إلى المنزل، يجب أن تكون قادرًا على المشي باستخدام المشاية (Walker) أو العكازات دون الحاجة إلى الكثير من المساعدة. معظم الناس لا يحتاجون إليها بعد 2 إلى 4 أسابيع. اسأل جرّاحك عن الوقت المناسب للتوقف عن استخدام العكازات.

يجب أيضًا أن تكون قادرًا على ارتداء ملابسك مع القليل من المساعدة فقط، وأن تتمكن من الدخول إلى السرير أو الكرسي والخروج منه بنفسك. كما يجب أن تكون قادرًا على استخدام المرحاض دون الكثير من المساعدة.

ستحتاج إلى الحذر حتى لا يخرج مفصل الورك الصناعي من مكانه (خلع المفصل)، خاصة في الأشهر الأولى بعد الجراحة. ستحتاج إلى تعلم تمارين تقوي مفصل الورك الجديد، واتخاذ احتياطات خاصة.

ستحتاج إلى وجود شخص معك في المنزل لمدة من 1 إلى 2 أسبوع بعد مغادرة المستشفى أو مركز التأهيل. ستحتاج إلى المساعدة في تحضير الطعام، والاستحمام، والحركة داخل المنزل، والقيام بالأنشطة اليومية الأخرى.

مع الوقت، يجب أن تكون قادرًا على العودة إلى مستوى نشاطك السابق. لكن ستحتاج إلى تجنب بعض الرياضات، مثل التزلج من أعلى الجبل (Downhill skiing) أو الرياضات العنيفة مثل كرة القدم الأمريكية وكرة القدم (Soccer). لكن يجب أن تكون قادرًا على ممارسة الأنشطة ذات التأثير الخفيف، مثل المشي في الطبيعة (Hiking)، والبستنة، والسباحة، ولعب التنس، ولعب الغولف.

ترتيب المنزل  
يجب أن يكون سريرك منخفضًا بما يكفي لتلمس قدماك الأرض عندما تجلس على حافة السرير. كما يجب أن يكون السرير مرتفعًا بما يكفي بحيث تكون وركاك أعلى من ركبتيك عندما تجلس على الحافة. قد لا تحتاج إلى سرير مستشفى، لكن يجب أن يكون الفراش (المرتبة) صلبًا.

You had surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint called a prosthesis. This article tells you what you need to do to care for your new hip when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You had a hip joint replacement surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.

What to Expect at Home
By the time you go home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without needing much help. Most people do not need them after 2 to 4 weeks. Check with your surgeon about when to stop using crutches.

You should also be able to dress yourself with only a little help and be able to get into and out of your bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help.

You will need to be careful that you do not dislocate your artificial hip, especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions.

You will need to have someone with you at home for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehab center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.

Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.

Home Setup
Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You may not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.

Keep tripping hazards out of your home.

أجريت جراحة لاستبدال كل أو جزء من مفصل الورك بمفصل صناعي يسمى "الطرف الصناعي" (prosthesis). يخبرك هذا المقال بما عليك القيام به للعناية بوركك الجديد عند مغادرة المستشفى.

عندما تكون في المستشفى
أجريت جراحة استبدال مفصل الورك لاستبدال كل أو جزء من مفصل الورك بمفصل صناعي. يسمى هذا المفصل الصناعي "الطرف الصناعي".

ما يمكن توقعه في المنزل
بحلول وقت عودتك إلى المنزل، يجب أن تكون قادراً على المشي باستخدام مشاية أو عكازات دون الحاجة إلى مساعدة كبيرة. لا يحتاج معظم الناس إليها بعد مرور 2 إلى 4 أسابيع. راجع جراحك بشأن موعد التوقف عن استخدام العكازات.

يجب أن تكون قادراً أيضاً على ارتداء ملابسك بمساعدة بسيطة فقط، وأن تكون قادراً على الصعود والنزول من سريرك أو الكرسي بمفردك. كما يجب أن تكون قادراً على استخدام المرحاض دون مساعدة كبيرة.

ستحتاج إلى توخي الحذر لعدم خلع مفصل الورك الصناعي، خاصة في الأشهر الأولى بعد الجراحة. ستحتاج إلى تعلم تمارين تجعل وركك الجديد أقوى واتخاذ احتياطات خاصة.

ستحتاج إلى وجود شخص معك في المنزل لمدة أسبوع إلى أسبوعين بعد مغادرة المستشفى أو مركز إعادة التأهيل. ستحتاج إلى مساعدة في إعداد الوجبات، والاستحمام، والتحرك في جميع أنحاء المنزل، والقيام بالأنشطة اليومية الأخرى.

بمرور الوقت، يجب أن تكون قادراً على العودة إلى مستوى نشاطك السابق. ستحتاج إلى تجنب بعض الرياضات، مثل التزلج على المنحدرات أو الرياضات التي تتطلب الاحتكاك الجسدي مثل كرة القدم الأمريكية وكرة القدم. ولكن يجب أن تكون قادراً على القيام بأنشطة منخفضة التأثير، مثل المشي لمسافات طويلة، والبستنة (أعمال الحديقة)، والسباحة، ولعب التنس، والجولف.

إعداد المنزل
يجب أن يكون سريرك منخفضاً بما يكفي لتلامس قدماك الأرض عندما تجلس على حافة السرير. ويجب أن يكون سريرك أيضاً مرتفعاً بما يكفي لتكون وركاك أعلى من ركبتيك عندما تجلس على الحافة. قد لا تحتاج إلى سرير مستشفى، لكن يجب أن تكون مرتبتك صلبة.

            <div class='text-box original'>Heart Failure - Discharge

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is no longer able to pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body efficiently. When symptoms become severe, a hospital stay may be necessary. This article discusses what you need to do to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You were in the hospital to have your heart failure treated. Heart failure occurs when the muscles of your heart are weak or have trouble relaxing, or both.

Your heart is a pump that moves fluids through your body. As with any pump, if the flow out of the pump is not enough, fluids do not move well and they get stuck in places they should not be. In your body, this means that fluid collects in your lungs, abdomen, and legs.

While you were in the hospital:
Your health care team closely adjusted the fluids you drank or received through an intravenous (IV) line. They also watched and measured how much urine you produced.
You may have received medicines to help your body get rid of extra fluids.
You may have had tests to check how well your heart was working.

What to Expect at Home
Your energy will slowly return. You may need help taking care of yourself when you first get home. You may feel sad or depressed. All of these things are normal.

Checking Yourself at Home
Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale when you get up -- before you eat but after you use the bathroom. Make sure you are wearing similar clothing each time you weigh yourself. Write down your weight every day on a chart so that you can keep track of it.

Throughout the day, ask yourself:
Is my energy level normal?
Do I get more short of breath when I am doing my everyday activities?
Are my clothes or shoes feeling tight?
Are my ankles or legs swelling?
Am I coughing more often? Does my cough sound wet?
Do I get short of breath at night or when I lie down?

فشل القلب هو حالة يكون فيها القلب غير قادر بعد على ضخ الدم الغني بالأكسجين بكفاءة إلى بقية الجسم. عندما تصبح الأعراض حادة، قد يكون البقاء في المستشفى ضروريًا. يناقش هذا المقال ما تحتاج إلى فعله للعناية بنفسك عندما تغادر المستشفى.

عندما تكون في المستشفى

كنت في المستشفى لتلقي علاج فشل القلب. يحدث فشل القلب عندما تكون عضلات قلبك ضعيفة أو تواجه صعوبة في الاسترخاء، أو كلاهما.

قلبك عبارة عن مضخة تنقل السوائل عبر جسمك. كما هو الحال مع أي مضخة، إذا لم يكن التدفق الخارج من المضخة كافيًا، فإن السوائل لا تتحرك بشكل جيد وتتراكم في أماكن لا يجب أن تكون فيها. في جسمك، هذا يعني أن السوائل تجمع في رئتيك وبطنك وساقيك.

بينما كنت في المستشفى:
فريق الرعاية الصحية لديك ضبط بعناية السوائل التي شربتها أو تلقيتها عبر خط الوريدي (IV). كما راقبوا وقاسوا كمية البول التي أنتجتها.
ربما تلقيت أدوية لمساعدة جسمك على التخلص من السوائل الزائدة.
ربما أجريت لك فحوصات للتحقق من مدى عمل قلبك بشكل صحيح.

ما يمكن توقعه في المنزل

ستعود طاقتك ببطء. قد تحتاج إلى مساعدة في العناية بنفسك عندما تعود أول مرة إلى المنزل. قد تشعر بالحزن أو الاكتئاب. كل هذه الأمور طبيعية.

الفحص الذاتي في المنزل

زن نفسك كل صباح على نفس الميزان عندما تستيقظ - قبل أن تأكل ولكن بعد أن تستخدم الحمام. تأكد من أنك ترتدي ملابس مشابهة في كل مرة تزن فيها نفسك. اكتب وزنك كل يوم على مخطط حتى تتمكن من متابعته.

طوال اليوم، اسأل نفسك:
• هل مستوى طاقتي طبيعي؟
• هل أشعر بمزيد من ضيق التنفس عندما أقوم بأنشطتي اليومية؟
• هل ملابسي أو حذائي أصبحا ضيقين؟
• هل كاحلاي أو ساقاي منتفختان؟
• هل أسعل بشكل متكرر أكثر؟ هل سعالي يبدو رطبًا؟
• هل أشعر بضيق التنفس ليلاً أو عندما أستلقي؟

إذا كنت تعاني من أعراض جديدة (أو مختلفة)، اسأل نفسك:
• هل تناولت شيئًا مختلفًا عن المعتاد أو جربت طعامًا جديدًا؟
• هل تناولت جميع أدويتي بالطريقة الصحيحة وفي الأوقات المناسبة؟

النظام الغذائي والسوائل

قد يطلب منك مقدم الرعاية الصحية أن تحد من كمية ما تشربه.

عندما لا يكون فشل القلب لديك شديدًا جدًا، قد لا تضطر إلى الحد من السوائل كثيرًا.

مع تفاقم فشل القلب لديك، قد يُطلب منك الحد من السوائل إلى 6 إلى 9 أكواب (1.5 إلى 2 لتر) في اليوم.

Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told. Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines with it or at different times, and eating certain foods can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

What to Expect at Home
Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. This may be important if:

You have already had blood clots in your leg, arm, heart, or brain.
Your health care provider is worried that a blood clot may form in your body. People who have a new heart valve, a large heart, a heart rhythm that is not normal, or other heart problems may need to take warfarin.
When you are taking warfarin, you may be more likely to bleed, even from activities you have always done.

Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines, and eating certain foods all can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

Taking Warfarin
It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told.

Take only the dose your provider has prescribed. If you miss a dose, contact your provider for advice.
If your pills look different from your last prescription, contact your provider or pharmacist right away. The tablets are different colors, depending on the dose. The dose is also marked on the pill.
Your provider will test your blood at regular visits. This is called an INR test or sometimes a PT test. The test helps make sure you are taking the right amount of warfarin to help your body.

Alcohol and some medicines can change how warfarin works in your body.

وارفارين هو دواء يجعل دمك أقل عرضة لتكوين جلطات. من المهم أن تتناول وارفارين تماماً كما تم إخبارك. يمكن أن يغيّر تغيير طريقة تناولك لوارفارين، أو تناول أدوية أخرى معه أو في أوقات مختلفة، وتناول أنواع معينة من الطعام الطريقة التي يعمل بها وارفارين في جسمك. إذا حدث ذلك، قد تصبح أكثر عرضة لتكوين جلطة أو الإصابة بمشاكل نزيف.

ما يمكن توقعه في المنزل

وارفارين هو دواء يجعل دمك أقل عرضة لتكوين جلطات. قد يكون هذا مهماً إذا:

- كنت قد أصبت بالفعل بجلطات دم في ساقك، أو ذراعك، أو قلبك، أو دماغك.
- كان مقدم الرعاية الصحية لديك قلقاً من أن تتكون جلطة دم في جسمك. قد يحتاج الأشخاص الذين لديهم صمام قلب جديد، أو قلب كبير، أو إيقاع قلب غير طبيعي، أو مشاكل قلبية أخرى إلى تناول وارفارين.

عندما تتناول وارفارين، قد تصبح أكثر عرضة للنزيف، حتى من الأنشطة التي اعتدت دائماً على القيام بها.

يمكن أن يغيّر تغيير طريقة تناولك لوارفارين، وتناول أدوية أخرى، وتناول أنواع معينة من الطعام الطريقة التي يعمل بها وارفارين في جسمك. إذا حدث ذلك، قد تصبح أكثر عرضة لتكوين جلطة أو الإصابة بمشاكل نزيف.

تناول وارفارين

من المهم أن تتناول وارفارين تماماً كما تم إخبارك.

- تناول الجرعة الموصوفة من قبل مقدم الرعاية الصحية فقط. إذا فاتتك جرعة، اتصل بمقدم الرعاية الصحية للحصول على المشورة.
- إذا كانت حبوبك تبدو مختلفة عن وصفتك الأخيرة، اتصل بمقدم الرعاية الصحية أو الصيدلي على الفور. الحبوب تأتي بألوان مختلفة، حسب الجرعة. كما أن الجرعة مدونة على الحبة.
- سيقوم مقدم الرعاية الصحية بفحص دمك أثناء الزيارات الدورية. يُسمى هذا اختبار INR أو أحياناً اختبار PT. يساعد هذا الاختبار على التأكد من أنك تتناول الكمية المناسبة من وارفارين لمساعدة جسمك.

يمكن للكحول وبعض الأدوية أن تغيّر الطريقة التي يعمل بها وارفارين في جسمك.

- لا تشرب الكحول أثناء تناولك لوارفارين.
- تحدث مع مقدم الرعاية الصحية قبل تناول أي أدوية أخرى لا تستلزم وصفة طبية، أو فيتامينات، أو مكملات غذائية، أو أدوية البرد، أو مضادات حيوية، أو أدوية أخرى.
- أخبر جميع مقدمي الرعاية الصحية أنك تتناول وارفارين. يشمل ذلك الأطباء، والممرضات، وطبيب الأسنان. قد تحتاج أحياناً إلى التوقف عن تناول وارفارين أو تناول جرعة أقل قبل إجراء عملية. تحدث دائماً إلى...</div>

            <div class='text-box original'>High blood pressure - what to ask your doctor

When your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the pressure of the blood against the artery walls is called your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is given as two numbers: systolic over diastolic blood pressure. Your systolic blood pressure is the highest blood pressure during the course of your heart beat cycle. Your diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure.

When your blood pressure gets too high, it puts extra stress on your heart and blood vessels. If your blood pressure stays high all the time, you will be at a higher risk for heart attacks and other vascular (blood vessel) diseases, strokes, kidney disease, and other health problems.

Below are questions you may want to ask your health care provider to help you take care of your blood pressure.

Questions
How can I change the way I live to lower my blood pressure?

What is a heart-healthy diet? Is it OK to ever eat something that is not heart healthy? What are some ways to eat healthy when I go to a restaurant?

عندما يضخ قلبك الدم إلى شرايينك، يُسمى الضغط الذي يمارسه الدم على جدران الشرايين بضغط الدم. يُعبر عن ضغط الدم برقمين: ضغط الدم الانقباضي فوق ضغط الدم الانبساطي. ضغط الدم الانقباضي هو أعلى ضغط للدم خلال دورة ضربات القلب. ضغط الدم الانبساطي هو أقل ضغط.

عندما يرتفع ضغط الدم لديك بشكل مفرط، فإنه يضع ضغطًا إضافيًا على قلبك وأوعيتك الدموية. إذا بقي ضغط الدم مرتفعًا طوال الوقت، فستكون في خطر أعلى للإصابة بنوبات قلبية وأمراض أوعية دموية أخرى، والسكتات الدماغية، وأمراض الكلى، ومشاكل صحية أخرى.

فيما يلي أسئلة قد ترغب في طرحها على مقدم الرعاية الصحية لمساعدتك في العناية بضغط الدم لديك.

**الأسئلة**

كيف يمكنني تغيير نمط حياتي لخفض ضغط الدم؟

ما هي الحمية الصحية للقلب؟ هل يجوز تناول أي شيء غير صحي للقلب أحيانًا؟ ما هي بعض الطرق لتناول الطعام الصحي عندما أذهب إلى المطعم؟

            <div class='text-box back-translated'>High blood pressure - what you should ask your doctor about

When your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the pressure that blood exerts on the walls of the arteries is called blood pressure. Blood pressure is expressed by two numbers: systolic blood pressure over diastolic blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure is the highest pressure of blood during the heartbeat cycle. Diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure.

When your blood pressure rises excessively, it puts additional pressure on your heart and blood vessels. If blood pressure remains high all the time, you will be at higher risk of heart attacks and other vascular diseases, strokes, kidney diseases, and other health problems.

Below are questions you may want to ask your healthcare provider to help you take care of your blood pressure.

**Questions**

How can I change my lifestyle to lower blood pressure?

What is the healthy diet for the heart? Is it permissible to eat anything unhealthy for the heart sometimes? What are some ways to eat healthy when I go to the restaurant?
Do I need to limit the amount of salt that I use? Are there other spices I can use to make my food taste good?
Is it permissible to drink alcohol? What is the permitted quantity?
What can I do to quit smoking? Is it permissible to be near other people who smoke?

Should I do blood pressure check at home?

What type of device should I buy? Where can I learn how to use it?
How many times do I need to check blood pressure? Should I write the results and bring them to my next visit?
If I cannot check blood pressure by myself, where can I check it?
What should blood pressure reading be? Should I rest before measuring blood pressure?
When should I contact the healthcare provider?

What is my cholesterol level? Do I need to take medications for it?

Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.

What is Low Blood Sugar?
Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.

You are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:

Insulin
Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)
You are also at increased risk of having low blood sugar if you have had previous low blood sugar levels.

Recognizing Low Blood Sugar
Know how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:

Weakness or feeling tired
Shaking
Sweating
Headache
Hunger
Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious
Feeling cranky
Trouble thinking clearly
Double or blurry vision
Fast or pounding heartbeat
Sometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:

Faint
Have a seizure
Go into a coma
Some people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.

Check Your Blood Sugar Often
Talk with your provider about when you should check your blood sugar every day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.

The most common causes of low blood sugar are:

Taking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time
Taking too much insul...</div>

نقص سكر الدم هو حالة تحدث عندما يكون مستوى سكر الدم (الجلوكوز) لديك أقل من المعدل الطبيعي. قد يحدث نقص سكر الدم لدى الأشخاص المصابين بالسكري الذين يتناولون الأنسولين أو أدوية معينة أخرى للتحكم في مرض السكري لديهم. يمكن أن يسبب نقص سكر الدم أعراضًا خطيرة. تعلم كيفية التعرف على أعراض نقص سكر الدم وكيفية الوقاية منها.

ما هو نقص سكر الدم؟
يُسمى نقص سكر الدم نقص السكري (hypoglycemia). يعتبر مستوى سكر الدم أقل من 70 ملغ/دل (3.9 مليمول/لتر) منخفضًا ويمكن أن يضرك. يعتبر مستوى سكر الدم أقل من 54 ملغ/دل (3.0 مليمول/لتر) سببًا للتصرف الفوري.

أنت معرض لخطر الإصابة بنقص سكر الدم إذا كنت مصابًا بالسكري وتتناول أيًا من أدوية السكري التالية:

الأنسولين
الجليبيورايد (مايكرونيز)، الجليبيزايد (جلوكوترول)، الجليميبيرايد (أماريل)، الريباجلينايد (براندين)، أو الناتيغلينايد (ستارليكس)
أنت معرض أيضًا لخطر متزايد للإصابة بنقص سكر الدم إذا كنت تعاني من مستويات منخفضة من سكر الدم سابقًا.

التعرف على نقص سكر الدم
تعرف على كيفية معرفة متى ينخفض سكر الدم لديك. تتضمن الأعراض:

الضعف أو الشعور بالتعب
الرعشة
التعرق
الصداع
الجوع
الشعور بعدم الارتياح أو العصبية أو القلق
الشعور بالانفعال
صعوبة التفكير بوضوح
رؤية مزدوجة أو ضبابية
دقات قلب سريعة أو قوية
قد يكون سكر الدم لديك منخفضًا جدًا في بعض الأحيان حتى لو لم تظهر عليك أعراض. إذا انخفض كثيرًا، قد:

تفقد الوعي
تعاني من نوبة صرع
تدخل في غيبوبة
يتوقف بعض الأشخاص الذين يعانون من السكري منذ فترة طويلة عن القدرة على الشعور بنقص سكر الدم. يُسمى هذا بعدم الإحساس بنقص السكري (hypoglycemic unawareness). اسأل مقدم الرعاية الصحية الخاص بك عما إذا كان ارتداء جهاز مراقبة الجلوكوز المستمر ومستشعره يمكن أن يساعدك في اكتشاف متى ينخفض سكر الدم لديك كثيرًا لمساعدتك على منع الأعراض.

افحص سكر الدم لديك بشكل متكرر
تحدث مع مقدم الرعاية الخاص بك حول متى يجب أن تفحص سكر الدم لديك كل يوم. يحتاج الأشخاص الذين يعانون من نقص سكر الدم إلى فحص سكر الدم لديهم بشكل أكثر تكرارًا.

أكثر أسباب نقص سكر الدم شيوعًا هي:

تناول الأنسولين أو دواء السكري في الوقت الخطأ
تناول جرعة زائدة من الأنسولين أو دواء السكري
تناول الأنسولين لتصحيح ارتفاع سكر الدم دون ت...</div>

            <div class='text-box original'>Asthma - quick-relief drugs

Asthma quick-relief medicines work fast to control asthma symptoms. You take them when you are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack. They are also called rescue medicines.

Many of these medicines are called "bronchodilators" because they open (dilate) and help relax the muscles of your airways (bronchi).

You and your health care provider can make a plan for the quick-relief medicines that work for you. This plan will include when you should take them and how much you should take.

Plan ahead. Make sure you do not run out. Bring enough medicine with you when you travel.

Short-acting Beta-agonists
Short-acting beta-agonists are the most common quick-relief medicines for treating asthma attacks and are considered to be bronchodilators.

They can be used just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise. They work by relaxing the muscles of your airways, and this lets you breathe better during an attack.

Tell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more to control your asthma symptoms. Your asthma may not be under control, and your provider may need to change your dose of daily control medicines.

Some quick-relief asthma medicines include:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline
Short-acting beta-agonists may cause these side effects:

Anxiety.
Fast and irregular heartbeats. Call your provider right away if you have this side effect.
Headache.
Restlessness.
Tremor (your hand or another part of your body may shake).
Oral Steroids
Your provider might prescribe oral steroids when you have an asthma attack that is not going away. These are medicines that you take by mouth as pills, capsules, or liquids.

Oral steroids are not quick-relief medicines but are often given for 7 to 14 days when your symptoms flare-up.

Oral steroids include:

Methylprednisolone
Prednisone

تعمل أدوية الإغاثة السريعة للربو بسرعة للتحكم في أعراض الربو. تتناولها عندما تسعل، أو تشعر بصفير في الصدر، أو تعاني من صعوبة في التنفس، أو تمر بنوبة ربو. تُسمى أيضًا أدوية الإنقاذ.

تُسمى العديد من هذه الأدوية "موسعات الشعب الهوائية" لأنها تفتح (توسع) وتساعد على إرخاء عضلات المجاري الهوائية (الشعب الهوائية).

يمكنك أنت ومقدم الرعاية الصحية وضع خطة للأدوية السريعة المفعول التي تناسبك. ستتضمن هذه الخطة متى يجب أن تتناولها وكمية الجرعة التي يجب أن تتناولها.

خطط مسبقًا. تأكد من ألا ينفذ منك الدواء. خذ معك كمية كافية من الدواء عند السفر.

محفزات بيتا قصيرة المفعول

تُعتبر محفزات بيتا قصيرة المفعول أكثر أدوية الإغاثة السريعة شيوعًا لعلاج نوبات الربو، وتُصنف على أنها موسعات للشعب الهوائية.

يمكن استخدامها قبل ممارسة التمارين مباشرة للمساعدة في منع أعراض الربو الناتجة عن التمارين. تعمل هذه الأدوية على إرخاء عضلات المجاري الهوائية، مما يساعدك على التنفس بشكل أفضل أثناء النوبة.

أخبر مقدم الرعاية الصحية إذا كنت تستخدم أدوية الإغاثة السريعة مرتين في الأسبوع أو أكثر للتحكم في أعراض الربو. قد لا يكون الربو تحت السيطرة، وقد يحتاج مقدم الرعاية إلى تغيير جرعة أدوية التحكم اليومية.

تتضمن بعض أدوية الإغاثة السريعة للربو:

• Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
• Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
• Metaproterenol
• Terbutaline

قد تسبب محفزات بيتا قصيرة المفعول هذه الآثار الجانبية:

• القلق.
• دقات قلب سريعة وغير منتظمة. اتصل بمقدم الرعاية الصحية فورًا إذا حدث لك هذا الأثر الجانبي.
• الصداع.
• العصبية أو عدم الاستقرار.
• الرعشة (قد ترتجف يدك أو جزء آخر من جسمك).

الستيرويدات عن طريق الفم

قد يصف لك مقدم الرعاية الصحية الستيرويدات عن طريق الفم عندما تمر بنوبة ربو لا تختفي. هذه أدوية تتناولها عن طريق الفم على شكل أقراص أو كبسولات أو سوائل.

الستيرويدات عن طريق الفم ليست أدوية إغاثة سريعة، ولكن غالبًا ما تُعطى لمدة 7 إلى 14 يومًا عندما تشتد أعراضك.

تتضمن الستيرويدات عن طريق الفم:

• Methylprednisolone

مثبطات إنزيم تحويل الأنجيوتنسين (ACE inhibitors) هي أدوية. تعالج مشاكل القلب والأوعية الدموية والكلى.

كيف تساعد مثبطات ACE

تُستخدم مثبطات ACE لعلاج أمراض القلب وارتفاع ضغط الدم. تجعل هذه الأدوية قلبك يعمل بجهد أقل عن طريق خفض ضغط الدم. هذا يمنع بعض أنواع أمراض القلب من التفاقم. معظم الأشخاص الذين يعانون من قصور القلب يتناولون واحداً من هذه الأدوية أو أدوية مماثلة.

تعالج هذه الأدوية ارتفاع ضغط الدم والسكتات الدماغية أو النوبات القلبية. قد تساعد في تقليل خطر إصابتك بالسكتة الدماغية أو النوبة القلبية.

كما تُستخدم لعلاج مشاكل الكلى. يمكن أن يساعد هذا في منع تدهور الكلى أو حتى تحسين وظائف الكلى، خاصة إذا كنت مصاباً بالسكري. إذا كنت تعاني من هذه المشاكل، اسأل طبيبك عما إذا كان يجب أن تتناول هذه الأدوية.

أنواع مثبطات ACE

هناك العديد من الأسماء والماركات المختلفة لمثبطات ACE. معظمها يعمل بنفس فعالية الآخر. قد تختلف الآثار الجانبية بين الأنواع المختلفة.

كيفية تناول مثبطات ACE

مثبطات ACE هي حبوب تتناولها عن طريق الفم. تناول جميع أدويتك حسبما أخبرك طبيبك. تابع مع طبيبك بانتظام. سيتحقق طبيبك من ضغط دمك ويجري فحوصات دم للتأكد من أن الأدوية تعمل بشكل صحيح. قد يغير طبيبك جرعتك من وقت لآخر. بالإضافة إلى ذلك:

- حاول تناول أدويتك في نفس الوقت كل يوم.
- لا تتوقف عن تناول أدويتك دون التحدث مع طبيبك أولاً.
- خطط مسبقاً حتى لا تنفد منك الأدوية. تأكد من أن لديك ما يكفي معك عند السفر.
- قبل تناول الإيبوبروفين (Advil، Motrin) أو الأسبرين، تحدث مع طبيبك.
- أخبر طبيبك عن الأدوية الأخرى التي تتناولها، بما في ذلك أي شيء اشتريته دون وصفة طبية، والمدرات للبول (حبوب الماء)، وحبوب البوتاسيوم، أو المكملات العشبية أو الغذائية.
- لا تتناول مثبطات ACE إذا كنت تخططين للحمل، أو حامل، أو ترضعين. اتصلي بطبيبك فوراً إذا أصبحت حاملاً أثناء تناولك لهذه الأدوية.

الآثار الجانبية

الآثار الجانبية لمثبطات ACE غير شائعة.

قد تعاني من سعال جاف. قد يختفي بعد فترة. قد يبدأ أيضاً بعد تناولك للدواء لبعض الوقت. أخبر طبيبك إذا ظهر لديك سعال. قد يساعد تقليل الجرعة أحياناً. لكن أحياناً، سيقوم طبيبك بتبديلك إلى دواء مختلف. لا تقلل جرعتك دون التحدث مع طبيبك أولاً.

You were in the hospital after having a stroke. A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain stops.

At home follow your health care provider's instructions on self-care. Use the information below as a reminder.

When You're in the Hospital
First, you received treatment to prevent further damage to the brain, and to help the heart, lungs, and other important organs heal.

After you were stable, your providers did testing and started treatment to help you recover from the stroke and prevent a future stroke. You may have stayed in a special unit that helps people recover after a stroke.

What to Expect at Home
Because of possible injury to the brain from the stroke, you may notice problems with:

Changes in behavior
Doing easy tasks
Memory
Moving one side of the body
Muscle spasms
Paying attention
Sensation or awareness of one part of the body
Swallowing
Talking or understanding others
Thinking
Seeing to one side (hemianopsia)
You may need help with daily activities you used to do alone before the stroke. You may have physical or occupational therapy to restore your ability to perform these functions.

Depression after a stroke is fairly common as you learn to live with the changes. It may develop soon after the stroke or up to 2 years after the stroke.

Do not drive your car without your provider's permission.

Moving Around
Moving around and doing normal tasks may be hard after a stroke.

Make sure your home is safe. Ask your provider, therapist, or nurse about making changes in your home to make it easier to do everyday activities.

كنت في المستشفى بعد إصابتك بسكتة دماغية. تحدث السكتة الدماغية عندما يتوقف تدفق الدم إلى جزء من الدماغ.

اتبع في المنزل تعليمات مقدم الرعاية الصحية الخاص بك بشأن الرعاية الذاتية. استخدم المعلومات أدناه كتذكير.

عندما تكون في المستشفى
أولاً، تلقيت علاجاً لمنع مزيد من الضرر للدماغ، وللمساعدة في شفاء القلب والرئتين والأعضاء الحيوية الأخرى.

بعد أن أصبحت حالتك مستقرة، أجرى مقدمو الرعاية لديك الفحوصات وبدأوا العلاج لمساعدتك على التعافي من السكتة الدماغية ومنع حدوث سكتة دماغية مستقبلية. ربما بقيت في وحدة خاصة تساعد الأشخاص على التعافي بعد السكتة الدماغية.

ما يمكن توقعه في المنزل
بسبب الإصابة المحتملة في الدماغ من السكتة الدماغية، قد تلاحظ مشاكل في:

• التغيرات في السلوك
• أداء المهام البسيطة
• الذاكرة
• تحريك جانب واحد من الجسم
• التقلصات العضلية
• الانتباه
• الإحساس أو الوعي بجزء من الجسم
• البلع
• التحدث أو فهم الآخرين
• التفكير
• الرؤية إلى جانب واحد (نصف العمى)

قد تحتاج إلى مساعدة في الأنشطة اليومية التي كنت تقوم بها بمفردك قبل السكتة الدماغية. قد تتلقى علاجاً طبيعياً أو علاجاً وظيفياً لاستعادة قدرتك على أداء هذه الوظائف.

الاكتئاب بعد السكتة الدماغية شائع إلى حد ما بينما تتعلم التعايش مع التغييرات. قد يتطور قريباً بعد السكتة الدماغية أو حتى بعد مرور عامين عليها.

لا تقد سيارتك دون إذن من مقدم الرعاية الخاص بك.

التنقل
قد يكون التنقل وأداء المهام الطبيعية صعباً بعد السكتة الدماغية.

تأكد من أن منزلك آمن. اسأل مقدم الرعاية الخاص بك أو المعالج أو الممرضة حول إجراء تغييرات في منزلك لجعله أسهل لأداء الأنشطة اليومية.

اكتشف ما يمكنك فعله لمنع السقوط والحفاظ على سلامة استخدام الحمام.

قد يحتاج أفراد العائلة ومقدمو الرعاية إلى المساعدة في:

• التمرينات للحفاظ على مرونة مفاصل مرفقيك وكتفيك ومفاصلك الأخرى
• مراقبة تشنج المفاصل (التقلصات المفصلية)
• التأكد من استخدام الجبائر بالطريقة الصحيحة
• التأكد من وضع الذراعين والساقين في وضعية جيدة عند الجلوس أو الاستلقاء

إذا كنت أنت أو شخصك المقرب تستخدم كرسياً متحركاً، فإن الزيارات المتابعة للتأكد من ملاءمته جيداً مهمة لمنع قرح الجلد.

            <div class='text-box original'>Surgical wound care - open

An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the kind of surgery you had.

Sometimes, an incision breaks open. This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).

What to Expect at Home
If your surgeon does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. A dressing helps absorb drainage and keep the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.

Proper Handwashing
It is important to clean your hands before you change your dressing. You can use an alcohol-based cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands using these steps:

Take all jewelry off your hands.
Wet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.
Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or the "Alphabet Song" one time through). Clean under your nails also.
Rinse well.
Dry with a clean towel.
Removing the Old Dressing
Your health care provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. To prepare for the dressing change:

Clean your hands before touching the dressing.
Make sure you have all the supplies handy.
Have a clean work surface.
Remove the old dressing:

Carefully loosen the tape from your skin.
Use a clean (not sterile) medical glove to grab the old dressing and pull it off.
If the dressing sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your provider instructed you to pull it off dry.
Put the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.
Clean your hands again after you take off the old dressing.

            <div class='text-box translated'>رعاية الجرح الجراحي - المفتوح

الشق الجراحي هو قطع يُجرى في الجلد أثناء العملية الجراحية. يُسمى أيضًا الجرح الجراحي. بعض الشقوق الجراحية صغيرة، والبعض الآخر طويل. يعتمد حجم الشق الجراحي على نوع العملية الجراحية التي أجريت لك.

في بعض الأحيان، ينفتح الشق الجراحي. قد يحدث هذا على طول القطع بالكامل أو جزء منه فقط. قد يقرر الجراح عدم إغلاقه مرة أخرى بالخيوط الجراحية (الغرز).

ما يُتوقع حدوثه في المنزل

إذا لم يُغلق الجراح جرحك مرة أخرى بالخيوط الجراحية، فأنت بحاجة إلى العناية به في المنزل، لأنه قد يستغرق وقتًا حتى يشفى. سيشفى الجرح من الأسفل إلى الأعلى. تساعد الضمادة على امتصاص الإفرازات ومنع الجلد من الإغلاق قبل أن يمتلئ الجرح الموجود تحته.

غسل اليدين بشكل صحيح

من المهم تنظيف يديك قبل تغيير ضمادتك. يمكنك استخدام مطهر كحولي. أو يمكنك غسل يديك باتباع هذه الخطوات:

1. أزل كل المجوهرات من يديك.
2. بلل يديك مع توجيههما لأسفل تحت ماء جارٍ دافئ.
3. أضف الصابون واغسل يديك لمدة 15 إلى 30 ثانية (غنِّ "عيد ميلاد سعيد" أو "أغنية الحروف الأبجدية" مرة واحدة). نظف تحت أظافرك أيضًا.
4. اشطف جيدًا.
5. جفف بمنشفة نظيفة.

إزالة الضمادة القديمة

سيقول لك مقدم الرعاية الصحية كم مرة يجب أن تغيّر ضمادتك. للتحضير لتغيير الضمادة:

1. نظف يديك قبل لمس الضمادة.
2. تأكد من أن لديك كل المستلزمات في متناول اليد.
3. أعد سطح عمل نظيف.

أزل الضمادة القديمة:

1. فكّ الشريط اللاصق من جلدك بعناية.
2. استخدم قفازًا طبيًا نظيفًا (غير معقم) لأخذ الضمادة القديمة وسحبها.
3. إذا التصقت الضمادة بالجرح، بللها وحاول مرة أخرى، ما لم يُصرّح لك مقدم الرعاية بسحبها جافة.
4. ضع الضمادة القديمة في كيس بلاستيكي وضعها جانبًا.

نظف يديك مرة أخرى بعد إزالة الضمادة القديمة.

العناية بالجرح

يمكنك استخدام ضمادة شاش أو قطعة قماش ناعمة لتنظيف الجلد حول جرحك:

1. استخدم محلول ملحي طبيعي (ماء مملح) أو ماء صابون خفيف.
2. انقع الشاش أو القماش في المحلول الملحي أو الماء الصابوني، وربّت أو امسح الجلد به برفق.
3. حاول إزالة كل الإفرازات وأي دم جاف أو مواد أخرى قد تراكمت على الجلد.

لا تستخدم منظفات الجلد أو الكحول أو بيروكسيد الهيدروجين أو اليود أو الصابون بمواد كيميائية مضادة للبكتيريا. يمكن أن تلحق هذه المواد ضررًا بأنسجة الجرح و...</div>

The surgical incision is a cut made in the skin during the surgical operation. It is also called the surgical wound. Some surgical incisions are small, and others are long. The size of the surgical incision depends on the type of surgical operation that was performed for you.

Sometimes, the surgical incision opens. This may happen along the entire cut or only part of it. The surgeon may decide not to close it again with surgical threads (sutures).

What is expected to happen at home

If the surgeon did not close your wound again with surgical threads, you need to take care of it at home, because it may take time until it heals. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. The dressing helps absorb secretions and prevent the skin from closing before the wound underneath it fills.

Washing hands properly

It is important to clean your hands before changing your dressing. You can use an alcohol sanitizer. Or you can wash your hands by following these steps:

1. Remove all jewelry from your hands.
2. Wet your hands while directing them downward under running warm water.
3. Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or "the Alphabet Song" once). Clean under your nails as well.
4. Rinse well.
5. Dry with a clean towel.

Removing the old dressing

The healthcare provider will tell you how many times you should change your dressing. To prepare for changing the dressing:

1. Clean your hands before touching the dressing.
2. Make sure you have all supplies within hand's reach.
3. Prepare a clean work surface.

Remove the old dressing:

1. Loosen the adhesive tape from your skin carefully.
2. Use a clean (non-sterile) medical glove to take the old dressing and pull it.

You had surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint called a prosthesis. This article tells you what you need to do to care for your new hip when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You had a hip joint replacement surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.

What to Expect at Home
By the time you go home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without needing much help. Most people do not need them after 2 to 4 weeks. Check with your surgeon about when to stop using crutches.

You should also be able to dress yourself with only a little help and be able to get into and out of your bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help.

You will need to be careful that you do not dislocate your artificial hip, especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions.

You will need to have someone with you at home for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehab center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.

Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.

Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You may not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.

Keep tripping hazards out of your home.

لقد خضعتَ لجراحة لاستبدال كل أو جزء من مفصل الورك لديك بمفصل صناعي يُسمى طِرْفاً صناعياً. يخبرك هذا المستند بما تحتاج إلى فعله للعناية بوركك الجديد عند مغادرتك المستشفى.

أثناء تواجدك في المستشفى
لقد خضعتَ لجراحة استبدال مفصل الورك لاستبدال كل أو جزء من مفصل الورك لديك بمفصل صناعي. يُسمى هذا المفصل الصناعي طِرْفاً صناعياً.

ما يُتوقع حدوثه في المنزل
بحلول وقت عودتك إلى المنزل، يجب أن تكون قادراً على المشي باستخدام المشاية أو العكازات دون الحاجة إلى مساعدة كبيرة. لا يحتاج معظم الناس إليها بعد 2 إلى 4 أسابيع. استشر جراحك بخصوص متى تتوقف عن استخدام العكازات.

يجب أن تكون قادراً أيضاً على ارتداء ملابسك بمساعدة طفيفة فقط وأن تكون قادراً على الدخول إلى سريرك أو الخروج منه والجلوس على كرسي بنفسك. يجب أن تكون قادراً أيضاً على استخدام المرحاض دون مساعدة كبيرة.

ستحتاج إلى توخي الحذر لعدم إخراج مفصل وركك الصناعي من مكانه (خلعه)، خاصة في الأشهر القليلة الأولى بعد الجراحة. ستحتاج إلى تعلم تمارين تجعل وركك الجديد أقوى واتخاذ احتياطات خاصة.

ستحتاج إلى وجود شخص معك في المنزل لمدة 1 إلى 2 أسبوع بعد مغادرتك المستشفى أو مركز إعادة التأهيل. ستحتاج إلى مساعدة في إعداد الوجبات والاستحمام والتنقل في المنزل وأداء الأنشطة اليومية الأخرى.

بمرور الوقت، يجب أن تكون قادراً على العودة إلى مستوى نشاطك السابق. ستحتاج إلى تجنب بعض الرياضات، مثل التزلج على المنحدرات أو الرياضات التلامسية مثل كرة القدم الأمريكية وكرة القدم. لكن يجب أن تكون قادراً على ممارسة الأنشطة منخفضة التأثير، مثل المشي لمسافات طويلة والبستنة والسباحة ولعب التنس والجولف.

إعداد المنزل
يجب أن يكون سريرك منخفضاً بما يكفي ليلمس قدماك الأرض عند جلوسك على حافة السرير. يجب أن يكون سريرك مرتفعاً أيضاً بحيث تكون وركك أعلى من ركبتيك عند جلوسك على الحافة. قد لا تحتاج إلى سرير مستشفى، لكن يجب أن يكون فراشك صلباً.

أبقِ مخاطر التعثر خارج منزلك.

تعلم كيفية منع السقوط.
• أزِل الأسلاك أو الأشرطة المفكوكة من المناطق التي تسلكها للانتقال من غرفة إلى أخرى.
• أزِل السجادات الصغيرة غير المثبتة.
• لا تربِّ حيوانات أليفة صغيرة في منزلك.
• أصلح أي أرضية غير مستوية في عتبات الأبواب.
• استخدم إضاءة جيدة.

You have undergone surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint called a prosthesis. This document tells you what you need to do to care for your new hip when you leave the hospital.

During Your Stay in the Hospital
You have undergone hip joint replacement surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.

What Is Expected to Happen at Home
By the time you return home, you should be able to walk using a walker or crutches without needing significant assistance. Most people do not need them after 2 to 4 weeks. Consult your surgeon regarding when to stop using crutches.

You should also be able to dress yourself with only slight assistance and be able to get into your bed or out of it and sit on a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without significant assistance.

You will need to be careful not to dislocate your artificial hip joint (dislocation), especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions.

You will need to have someone with you at home for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehabilitation center. You will need help with preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and performing other daily activities.

Over time, you should be able to return to your previous level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as skiing on slopes or contact sports like American football and soccer. But you should be able to practice low-impact activities, such as walking long distances, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golf.

Preparing the Home
