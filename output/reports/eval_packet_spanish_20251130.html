            <div class='text-box original'>Heart Failure - Discharge

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is no longer able to pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body efficiently. When symptoms become severe, a hospital stay may be necessary. This article discusses what you need to do to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You were in the hospital to have your heart failure treated. Heart failure occurs when the muscles of your heart are weak or have trouble relaxing, or both.

Your heart is a pump that moves fluids through your body. As with any pump, if the flow out of the pump is not enough, fluids do not move well and they get stuck in places they should not be. In your body, this means that fluid collects in your lungs, abdomen, and legs.

While you were in the hospital:
Your health care team closely adjusted the fluids you drank or received through an intravenous (IV) line. They also watched and measured how much urine you produced.
You may have received medicines to help your body get rid of extra fluids.
You may have had tests to check how well your heart was working.

What to Expect at Home
Your energy will slowly return. You may need help taking care of yourself when you first get home. You may feel sad or depressed. All of these things are normal.

Checking Yourself at Home
Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale when you get up -- before you eat but after you use the bathroom. Make sure you are wearing similar clothing each time you weigh yourself. Write down your weight every day on a chart so that you can keep track of it.

Throughout the day, ask yourself:
Is my energy level normal?
Do I get more short of breath when I am doing my everyday activities?
Are my clothes or shoes feeling tight?
Are my ankles or legs swelling?
Am I coughing more often? Does my cough sound wet?
Do I get short of breath at night or when I lie down?

If you are having new (or different) symptoms, ask yourself:

Did I eat something different than usua...</div>

            <div class='text-box translated'>Insuficiencia cardíaca - Alta

La insuficiencia cardíaca es una afección en la que el corazón ya no puede bombear sangre rica en oxígeno al resto del cuerpo de manera eficiente. Cuando los síntomas se vuelven graves, puede ser necesaria una hospitalización. Este artículo explica lo que usted necesita hacer para cuidarse cuando salga del hospital.

Cuando está en el hospital
Usted estuvo en el hospital para que le trataran la insuficiencia cardíaca. La insuficiencia cardíaca ocurre cuando los músculos de su corazón están débiles o tienen dificultad para relajarse, o ambas cosas.

Su corazón es una bomba que mueve líquidos por todo su cuerpo. Como con cualquier bomba, si el flujo que sale de la bomba no es suficiente, los líquidos no se mueven bien y se quedan atascados en lugares donde no deberían estar. En su cuerpo, esto significa que el líquido se acumula en los pulmones, el abdomen y las piernas.

Mientras estuvo en el hospital:
Su equipo de atención médica ajustó cuidadosamente los líquidos que usted bebía o recibía por una vía intravenosa (IV). También observaron y midieron cuánta orina producía.
Es posible que haya recibido medicamentos para ayudar a su cuerpo a eliminar el exceso de líquidos.
Es posible que le hayan hecho pruebas para revisar qué tan bien estaba funcionando su corazón.

Qué esperar en casa
Su energía volverá poco a poco. Es posible que necesite ayuda para cuidarse cuando recién llegue a casa. Puede sentirse triste o deprimido. Todas estas cosas son normales.

Cómo revisarse en casa
Pésese todas las mañanas en la misma báscula cuando se levante, antes de comer pero después de usar el baño. Asegúrese de usar ropa similar cada vez que se pese. Anote su peso todos los días en una tabla para poder llevar un registro.

Durante el día, pregúntese:
¿Mi nivel de energía es normal?
¿Me falta más el aire cuando hago mis actividades diarias?
¿Mi ropa o mis zapatos se sienten apretados?
¿Se me hinchan los tobillos o las piernas?
¿Estoy tosiendo con más fr...</div>

Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told. Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines with it or at different times, and eating certain foods can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

What to Expect at Home
Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. This may be important if:

You have already had blood clots in your leg, arm, heart, or brain.
Your health care provider is worried that a blood clot may form in your body. People who have a new heart valve, a large heart, a heart rhythm that is not normal, or other heart problems may need to take warfarin.
When you are taking warfarin, you may be more likely to bleed, even from activities you have always done.

Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines, and eating certain foods all can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

Taking Warfarin
It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told.

Take only the dose your provider has prescribed. If you miss a dose, contact your provider for advice.
If your pills look different from your last prescription, contact your provider or pharmacist right away. The tablets are different colors, depending on the dose. The dose is also marked on the pill.
Your provider will test your blood at regular visits. This is called an INR test or sometimes a PT test. The test helps make sure you are taking the right amount of warfarin to help your body.

Alcohol and some medicines can change how warfarin works in your body.

DO NOT drink alcohol while you are taking warfarin.
Talk with your provider before taking any other over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, supplements, cold medicines, antibiotics, or other medicines.

La warfarina es un medicamento que hace que su sangre sea menos propensa a formar coágulos. Es importante que tome la warfarina exactamente como se le indicó. Cambiar la forma en que toma su warfarina, tomar otros medicamentos junto con ella o en horarios diferentes, y comer ciertos alimentos puede cambiar la manera en que la warfarina actúa en su cuerpo. Si esto sucede, puede ser más probable que forme un coágulo o que tenga problemas de sangrado.

Qué esperar en casa
La warfarina es un medicamento que hace que su sangre sea menos propensa a formar coágulos. Esto puede ser importante si:

Ya ha tenido coágulos de sangre en la pierna, el brazo, el corazón o el cerebro.
Su proveedor de atención médica está preocupado de que se pueda formar un coágulo de sangre en su cuerpo. Las personas que tienen una válvula cardíaca nueva, un corazón agrandado, un ritmo cardíaco que no es normal u otros problemas del corazón pueden necesitar tomar warfarina.
Cuando está tomando warfarina, puede ser más probable que sangre, incluso por actividades que siempre ha hecho.

Cambiar la forma en que toma su warfarina, tomar otros medicamentos y comer ciertos alimentos puede cambiar la manera en que la warfarina actúa en su cuerpo. Si esto sucede, puede ser más probable que forme un coágulo o que tenga problemas de sangrado.

Tomar warfarina
Es importante que tome la warfarina exactamente como se le indicó.

Tome solo la dosis que su proveedor le haya recetado. Si olvida una dosis, comuníquese con su proveedor para pedir consejo.
Si sus pastillas se ven diferentes a las de su receta anterior, comuníquese de inmediato con su proveedor o farmacéutico. Las tabletas son de diferentes colores, según la dosis. La dosis también está marcada en la pastilla.
Su proveedor le hará análisis de sangre en visitas regulares. Esto se llama prueba de INR o a veces prueba de PT. La prueba ayuda a asegurarse de que está tomando la cantidad correcta de warfarina para ayudar a su cuerpo.

A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to a part of your heart is blocked for enough time so that that part of the heart muscle is damaged or dies. This article analyzes what you need to do to take care of yourself after leaving the hospital.

When you are in the hospital
You were in the hospital because you had a heart attack. A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to a part of your heart is blocked for enough time so that that part of the heart muscle is damaged or dies.

What to expect at home
It is possible that you feel sad. You may feel anxious and as if you had to be very careful with what you do. All these feelings are normal. They disappear for most people after 2 or 3 weeks. You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home.

Activity
You must know the signs and symptoms of angina.

*   You may feel pressure, squeezing, burning, or tightness in the chest. You may also notice these symptoms in the arms, the shoulders, the neck, the jaw, the throat, or the back.
*   Some people also feel discomfort in the back, the shoulders, and the stomach area.
*   You may have indigestion or feel stomach upset.
*   You may feel tired and have shortness of breath, be sweaty, dizzy, or weak.
*   You may have angina during physical activity, such as climbing stairs or walking uphill, lifting objects, during sexual activity, or when you are outside in cold weather. It can also happen when you are resting or it can wake you up when you are sleeping.
*   Know how to treat your chest pain when it occurs. Talk to your health care provider about what to do.

Take it easy during the first 4 to 6 weeks after your heart attack.

*   Avoid lifting heavy objects. Get help with household chores if you can.
*   Take 30 to 60 minutes to rest in the afternoon during the first 4 to 6 weeks. Try to go to bed early and get enough sleep.
*   Before starting to exercise, your provider may ask you to do a stress test and recommend an ex...</div>

            <div class='text-box original'>High blood pressure - what to ask your doctor

When your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the pressure of the blood against the artery walls is called your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is given as two numbers: systolic over diastolic blood pressure. Your systolic blood pressure is the highest blood pressure during the course of your heart beat cycle. Your diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure.

When your blood pressure gets too high, it puts extra stress on your heart and blood vessels. If your blood pressure stays high all the time, you will be at a higher risk for heart attacks and other vascular (blood vessel) diseases, strokes, kidney disease, and other health problems.

Below are questions you may want to ask your health care provider to help you take care of your blood pressure.

Questions
How can I change the way I live to lower my blood pressure?

What is a heart-healthy diet? Is it OK to ever eat something that is not heart healthy? What are some ways to eat healthy when I go to a restaurant?
Do I need to limit how much salt I use? Are there other spices that I can use to make my food taste good?
Is it OK to drink alcohol? How much is OK?
What can I do to stop smoking? Is it OK to be around other people who are smoking?
Should I check my blood pressure at home?

What type of equipment should I buy? Where can I learn how to use it?
How often do I need to check my blood pressure? Should I write it down and bring it to my next visit?
If I cannot check my own blood pressure, where else can I have it checked?

Cuando su corazón bombea sangre a sus arterias, la presión de la sangre contra las paredes de las arterias se llama presión arterial. Su presión arterial se da como dos números: presión arterial sistólica sobre presión arterial diastólica. Su presión arterial sistólica es la presión arterial más alta durante el ciclo de latido de su corazón. Su presión arterial diastólica es la presión más baja.

Cuando su presión arterial se eleva demasiado, pone estrés adicional en su corazón y en sus vasos sanguíneos. Si su presión arterial se mantiene alta todo el tiempo, tendrá un mayor riesgo de ataques cardíacos y otras enfermedades vasculares (de los vasos sanguíneos), accidentes cerebrovasculares, enfermedad renal y otros problemas de salud.

A continuación se presentan preguntas que puede querer hacerle a su proveedor de atención médica para ayudarle a cuidar su presión arterial.

            <div class='text-box original'>Low blood sugar - self-care

Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.

What is Low Blood Sugar?
Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.

You are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:

Insulin
Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)
You are also at increased risk of having low blood sugar if you have had previous low blood sugar levels.

Recognizing Low Blood Sugar
Know how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:

Weakness or feeling tired
Shaking
Sweating
Headache
Hunger
Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious
Feeling cranky
Trouble thinking clearly
Double or blurry vision
Fast or pounding heartbeat
Sometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:

Faint
Have a seizure
Go into a coma
Some people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.

Check Your Blood Sugar Often
Talk with your provider about when you should check your blood sugar every day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.

The most common causes of low blood sugar are:

Taking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time
Taking too much insul...</div>

Al nivel bajo de azúcar en la sangre se le llama hipoglucemia. Un nivel de azúcar en la sangre por debajo de 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) es bajo y puede hacerle daño. Un nivel de azúcar en la sangre por debajo de 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) es motivo para tomar medidas inmediatas.

Usted corre riesgo de tener un nivel bajo de azúcar en la sangre si tiene diabetes y toma alguno de los siguientes medicamentos para la diabetes:

*   Insulina
*   Gliburida (Micronase), glipizida (Glucotrol), glimepirida (Amaryl), repaglinida (Prandin) o nateglinida (Starlix)

También tiene un mayor riesgo de tener un nivel bajo de azúcar en la sangre si ha tenido niveles bajos anteriormente.

Cómo reconocer el nivel bajo de azúcar en la sangre
Sepa cómo darse cuenta cuando su nivel de azúcar en la sangre está bajando. Los síntomas incluyen:

*   Debilidad o sensación de cansancio
*   Temblores
*   Sudoración
*   Dolor de cabeza
*   Hambre
*   Sensación de inquietud, nerviosismo o ansiedad
*   Sentirse de mal humor o irritable
*   Dificultad para pensar con claridad
*   Visión doble o borrosa
*   Latidos rápidos o fuertes (palpitaciones)

A veces, su nivel de azúcar en la sangre puede estar demasiado bajo incluso si no tiene síntomas. Si baja demasiado, usted podría:

*   Desmayarse
*   Tener una convulsión
*   Entrar en coma

Algunas personas que han tenido diabetes por mucho tiempo dejan de ser capaces de sentir el nivel bajo de azúcar en la sangre. A esto se le llam...</div>

Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar can occur in people with diabetes who take insulin or other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.

What is low blood sugar?
Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is reason to take immediate measures.

You run the risk of having low blood sugar if you have diabetes and take any of the following medicines for diabetes:

*   Insulin
*   Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin) or nateglinide (Starlix)

You also have a higher risk of having low blood sugar if you have had low levels previously.

How to recognize low blood sugar
Know how to tell when your blood sugar level is going down. Symptoms include:

*   Weakness or feeling of tiredness
*   Tremors
*   Sweating
*   Headache
*   Hunger
*   Feeling of restlessness, nervousness, or anxiety
*   Feeling in a bad mood or irritable
*   Difficulty thinking clearly
*   Double or blurry vision
*   Fast or strong heartbeats (palpitations)

Sometimes, your blood sugar level can be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it goes down too much, you could:

*   Faint
*   Have a seizure
*   Go into a coma

Some people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to feel low blood sugar. This is called lack of perception of hypoglycemia. Ask your health care provider if using a continuous glucose monitor and a sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is going down too much to help prevent symptoms.

Check your blood sugar level frequently
Talk to your provider about when you should check your blood sugar level each day. People who have low blood sugar levels need to check themselves m...</div>

Asthma quick-relief medicines work fast to control asthma symptoms. You take them when you are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack. They are also called rescue medicines.

Many of these medicines are called "bronchodilators" because they open (dilate) and help relax the muscles of your airways (bronchi).

You and your health care provider can make a plan for the quick-relief medicines that work for you. This plan will include when you should take them and how much you should take.

Plan ahead. Make sure you do not run out. Bring enough medicine with you when you travel.

Short-acting Beta-agonists
Short-acting beta-agonists are the most common quick-relief medicines for treating asthma attacks and are considered to be bronchodilators.

They can be used just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise. They work by relaxing the muscles of your airways, and this lets you breathe better during an attack.

Tell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more to control your asthma symptoms. Your asthma may not be under control, and your provider may need to change your dose of daily control medicines.

Some quick-relief asthma medicines include:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline
Short-acting beta-agonists may cause these side effects:

Anxiety.
Fast and irregular heartbeats. Call your provider right away if you have this side effect.
Headache.
Restlessness.
Tremor (your hand or another part of your body may shake).
Oral Steroids
Your provider might prescribe oral steroids when you have an asthma attack that is not going away. These are medicines that you take by mouth as pills, capsules, or liquids.

Oral steroids are not quick-relief medicines but are often given for 7 to 14 days when your symptoms flare-up.

Oral steroids include:

Methylprednisolone
Prednisone

            <div class='text-box back-translated'>ACE Inhibitors

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are medications. They treat heart, blood vessel, and kidney problems.

How ACE inhibitors help
ACE inhibitors are used to treat heart diseases and high blood pressure. These medications make your heart work less by lowering your blood pressure. This prevents some types of heart diseases from getting worse. Most people who have heart failure take one of these medications or similar medications.

These medications treat high blood pressure, strokes, or heart attacks. They can help decrease your risk of having a stroke or a heart attack.

They are also used to treat kidney problems. This can help prevent your kidneys from getting worse or even improve the functioning of your kidneys, especially if you have diabetes. If you have these problems, ask your health care provider if you should take these medications.

Types of ACE inhibitors
There are many different names and brands of ACE inhibitors. Most work just as well as the others. Side effects may be different for each one.

How to take your ACE inhibitors
ACE inhibitors are pills that are taken by mouth. Take all your medications as your provider indicated to you. Go to your check-up appointments with your provider regularly. Your provider will check your blood pressure and do blood tests to make sure the medications are working correctly. Your provider may change your dose from time to time. Also:

*   Try to take your medications at the same time every day.
*   Do not stop taking your medications without talking to your provider first.
*   Plan ahead so you do not run out of medication. Make sure to have enough when you travel.
*   Before taking ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or aspirin, talk to your provider.
*   Tell your provider what other medications you are taking, including anything you have bought without a prescription, diuretics (pills to eliminate fluid), potassium pills, or herbal or dietary supplements.
*   Do not take ACE inhibitors if you plan...</div>

You were in the hospital after having a stroke. A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain stops.

At home follow your health care provider's instructions on self-care. Use the information below as a reminder.

When You're in the Hospital
First, you received treatment to prevent further damage to the brain, and to help the heart, lungs, and other important organs heal.

After you were stable, your providers did testing and started treatment to help you recover from the stroke and prevent a future stroke. You may have stayed in a special unit that helps people recover after a stroke.

What to Expect at Home
Because of possible injury to the brain from the stroke, you may notice problems with:

Changes in behavior
Doing easy tasks
Memory
Moving one side of the body
Muscle spasms
Paying attention
Sensation or awareness of one part of the body
Swallowing
Talking or understanding others
Thinking
Seeing to one side (hemianopsia)
You may need help with daily activities you used to do alone before the stroke. You may have physical or occupational therapy to restore your ability to perform these functions.

Depression after a stroke is fairly common as you learn to live with the changes. It may develop soon after the stroke or up to 2 years after the stroke.

Do not drive your car without your provider's permission.

Moving Around
Moving around and doing normal tasks may be hard after a stroke.

Make sure your home is safe. Ask your provider, therapist, or nurse about making changes in your home to make it easier to do everyday activities.

An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the kind of surgery you had.

Sometimes, an incision breaks open. This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).

What to Expect at Home
If your surgeon does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. A dressing helps absorb drainage and keep the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.

Proper Handwashing
It is important to clean your hands before you change your dressing. You can use an alcohol-based cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands using these steps:

Take all jewelry off your hands.
Wet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.
Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or the "Alphabet Song" one time through). Clean under your nails also.
Rinse well.
Dry with a clean towel.
Removing the Old Dressing
Your health care provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. To prepare for the dressing change:

Clean your hands before touching the dressing.
Make sure you have all the supplies handy.
Have a clean work surface.
Remove the old dressing:

Carefully loosen the tape from your skin.
Use a clean (not sterile) medical glove to grab the old dressing and pull it off.
If the dressing sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your provider instructed you to pull it off dry.
Put the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.
Clean your hands again after you take off the old dressing.
Caring for the Wound
You may use a gauze pad or soft cloth to clean the skin around your wound:

Una incisión es un corte a través de la piel que se hace durante una cirugía. También se llama herida quirúrgica. Algunas incisiones son pequeñas, otras son largas. El tamaño de la incisión depende del tipo de cirugía que le hicieron.

A veces, una incisión se abre. Esto puede ocurrir a lo largo de todo el corte o solo en una parte. Su cirujano puede decidir no volver a cerrarla con suturas (puntos).

Qué esperar en casa  
Si su cirujano no vuelve a cerrar su herida con suturas, usted tendrá que cuidarla en casa, ya que puede tardar en sanar. La herida sanará de abajo hacia arriba. Un vendaje ayuda a absorber el drenaje y evita que la piel se cierre antes de que la herida por debajo se llene.

Lavado adecuado de manos  
Es importante limpiar sus manos antes de cambiar su vendaje. Puede usar un limpiador a base de alcohol. O puede lavarse las manos siguiendo estos pasos:

Quítese todas las joyas de las manos.  
Mójese las manos, apuntándolas hacia abajo bajo el agua tibia corriente.  
Agregue jabón y lávese las manos durante 15 a 30 segundos (cante “Feliz cumpleaños” o la “Canción del alfabeto” una vez completa). Limpie también debajo de las uñas.  
Enjuáguese bien.  
Séquese con una toalla limpia.  

Retirar el vendaje viejo  
Su proveedor de atención médica le dirá con qué frecuencia debe cambiar su vendaje. Para prepararse para el cambio de vendaje:

Límpiese las manos antes de tocar el vendaje.  
Asegúrese de tener todos los suministros a la mano.  
Tenga una superficie de trabajo limpia.  

Retire el vendaje viejo:

Despegue con cuidado la cinta adhesiva de su piel.  
Use un guante médico limpio (no estéril) para agarrar el vendaje viejo y retirarlo.  
Si el vendaje se pega a la herida, humedézcalo e inténtelo de nuevo, a menos que su proveedor le haya indicado que lo retire en seco.  
Coloque el vendaje viejo en una bolsa de plástico y póngalo a un lado.

Una incisión es un corte a través de la piel que se hace durante una cirugía. También se llama herida quirúrgica. Algunas incisiones son pequeñas, otras son largas. El tamaño de la incisión depende del tipo de cirugía que le hicieron.

A veces, una incisión se abre. Esto puede ocurrir a lo largo de todo el corte o solo en parte de él. Su cirujano puede decidir no cerrarla nuevamente con suturas (puntos).

Qué esperar en casa
Si su cirujano no cierra su herida nuevamente con suturas, usted necesita cuidarla en casa, ya que puede tomar tiempo en sanar. La herida sanará desde el fondo hacia arriba. Un vendaje ayuda a absorber el drenaje y evita que la piel se cierre antes de que la herida de abajo se llene.

Lavado de manos adecuado
Es importante limpiar sus manos antes de cambiar su vendaje. Puede usar un limpiador a base de alcohol. O puede lavarse las manos siguiendo estos pasos:

Quítese todas las joyas de las manos.
Moje sus manos, apuntándolas hacia abajo bajo agua tibia corriente.
Agregue jabón y lávese las manos durante 15 a 30 segundos (cante "Cumpleaños Feliz" o la canción del "Abecedario" una vez completa). Límpiese debajo de las uñas también.
Enjuague bien.
Séquese con una toalla limpia.
Cómo quitar el vendaje viejo
Su proveedor de atención médica le dirá con qué frecuencia cambiar su vendaje. Para prepararse para el cambio de vendaje:

Límpiese las manos antes de tocar el vendaje.
Asegúrese de tener todos los suministros a la mano.
Tenga una superficie de trabajo limpia.
Quite el vendaje viejo:

Afloje cuidadosamente la cinta de su piel.
Use un guante médico limpio (no estéril) para agarrar el vendaje viejo y retirarlo.
Si el vendaje se pega a la herida, mójelo e intente nuevamente, a menos que su proveedor le haya indicado que lo retire en seco.
Ponga el vendaje viejo en una bolsa de plástico y déjelo a un lado.
Límpiese las manos nuevamente después de quitar el vendaje viejo.

An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the type of surgery they performed on you.

Sometimes, an incision opens. This can occur along the entire cut or only in part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).

What to expect at home
If your surgeon does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it can take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom up. A bandage helps absorb the drainage and prevents the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.

Proper hand washing
It is important to clean your hands before changing your bandage. You can use an alcohol-based cleaner. Or you can wash your hands following these steps:

Remove all jewelry from your hands.
Wet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.
Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or the "Alphabet" song once completely). Clean under your nails also.
Rinse well.
Dry with a clean towel.
How to remove the old bandage
Your health care provider will tell you how often to change your bandage. To prepare for the bandage change:

Clean your hands before touching the bandage.
Make sure you have all supplies at hand.
Have a clean work surface.
Remove the old bandage:

Carefully loosen the tape from your skin.
Use a clean (not sterile) medical glove to grab the old bandage and remove it.

An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the kind of surgery you had.

Sometimes, an incision breaks open. This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).

What to Expect at Home
If your surgeon does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. A dressing helps absorb drainage and keep the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.

Proper Handwashing

You had surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint called a prosthesis. This article tells you what you need to do to care for your new hip when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You had a hip joint replacement surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.

What to Expect at Home
By the time you go home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without needing much help. Most people do not need them after 2 to 4 weeks. Check with your surgeon about when to stop using crutches.

You should also be able to dress yourself with only a little help and be able to get into and out of your bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help.

You will need to be careful that you do not dislocate your artificial hip, especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions.

You will need to have someone with you at home for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehab center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.

Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.

Home Setup
Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You may not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.

Keep tripping hazards out of your home.

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is no longer able to pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body efficiently. When symptoms become severe, a hospital stay may be necessary. This article discusses what you need to do to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You were in the hospital to have your heart failure treated. Heart failure occurs when the muscles of your heart are weak or have trouble relaxing, or both.

Your heart is a pump that moves fluids through your body. As with any pump, if the flow out of the pump is not enough, fluids do not move well and they get stuck in places they should not be. In your body, this means that fluid collects in your lungs, abdomen, and legs.

While you were in the hospital:
Your health care team closely adjusted the fluids you drank or received through an intravenous (IV) line. They also watched and measured how much urine you produced.
You may have received medicines to help your body get rid of extra fluids.
You may have had tests to check how well your heart was working.

What to Expect at Home
Your energy will slowly return. You may need help taking care of yourself when you first get home. You may feel sad or depressed. All of these things are normal.

Checking Yourself at Home
Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale when you get up -- before you eat but after you use the bathroom. Make sure you are wearing similar clothing each time you weigh yourself. Write down your weight every day on a chart so that you can keep track of it.

Throughout the day, ask yourself:
Is my energy level normal?
Do I get more short of breath when I am doing my everyday activities?
Are my clothes or shoes feeling tight?
Are my ankles or legs swelling?
Am I coughing more often? Does my cough sound wet?
Do I get short of breath at night or when I lie down?

If you are having new (or different) symptoms, ask yourself:

Did I eat something different than usua...</div>

La insuficiencia cardíaca es una afección en la que el corazón ya no puede bombear eficientemente sangre rica en oxígeno al resto del cuerpo. Cuando los síntomas se vuelven graves, puede ser necesario una estancia hospitalaria. Este artículo explica lo que debe hacer para cuidarse cuando sale del hospital.

Cuando esté en el hospital

Estuvo en el hospital para que trataran su insuficiencia cardíaca. La insuficiencia cardíaca ocurre cuando los músculos del corazón están débiles o tienen dificultad para relajarse, o ambas cosas.

Su corazón es una bomba que mueve fluidos por todo su cuerpo. Al igual que con cualquier bomba, si el flujo que sale de la bomba no es suficiente, los fluidos no se mueven bien y se atascan en lugares donde no deberían estar. En su cuerpo, esto significa que el fluido se acumula en los pulmones, el abdomen y las piernas.

Mientras estuvo en el hospital:
• Su equipo de atención médica ajustó de cerca los fluidos que bebió o recibió a través de una línea intravenosa (IV). También observaron y midieron cuánta orina produjo.
• Es posible que haya recibido medicamentos para ayudar a su cuerpo a deshacerse de los fluidos extra.
• Es posible que le hayan hecho pruebas para verificar qué tan bien funcionaba su corazón.

Qué esperar en casa

Su energía volverá poco a poco. Puede que necesite ayuda para cuidarse cuando llegue a casa. Puede sentirse triste o deprimido. Todas estas cosas son normales.

Cómo vigilarse en casa

Pésese todas las mañanas en la misma báscula cuando se levante — antes de comer pero después de usar el baño. Asegúrese de llevar puesta ropa similar cada vez que se pese. Anote su peso todos los días en una gráfica para poder hacer un seguimiento.

Durante el día, pregúntese:
• ¿Mi nivel de energía es normal?
• ¿Tengo más falta de aire cuando hago mis actividades cotidianas?
• ¿Siento mi ropa o zapatos apretados?
• ¿Tengo hinchazón en los tobillos o las piernas?
• ¿Toso con más frecuenci...</div>

Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told. Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines with it or at different times, and eating certain foods can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

What to Expect at Home
Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. This may be important if:

You have already had blood clots in your leg, arm, heart, or brain.
Your health care provider is worried that a blood clot may form in your body. People who have a new heart valve, a large heart, a heart rhythm that is not normal, or other heart problems may need to take warfarin.
When you are taking warfarin, you may be more likely to bleed, even from activities you have always done.

Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines, and eating certain foods all can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

Taking Warfarin
It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told.

Take only the dose your provider has prescribed. If you miss a dose, contact your provider for advice.
If your pills look different from your last prescription, contact your provider or pharmacist right away. The tablets are different colors, depending on the dose. The dose is also marked on the pill.
Your provider will test your blood at regular visits. This is called an INR test or sometimes a PT test. The test helps make sure you are taking the right amount of warfarin to help your body.

Alcohol and some medicines can change how warfarin works in your body.

DO NOT drink alcohol while you are taking warfarin.

When your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the pressure of the blood against the artery walls is called your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is given as two numbers: systolic over diastolic blood pressure. Your systolic blood pressure is the highest blood pressure during the course of your heart beat cycle. Your diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure.

When your blood pressure gets too high, it puts extra stress on your heart and blood vessels. If your blood pressure stays high all the time, you will be at a higher risk for heart attacks and other vascular (blood vessel) diseases, strokes, kidney disease, and other health problems.

Below are questions you may want to ask your health care provider to help you take care of your blood pressure.

Cuando su corazón bombea sangre hacia sus arterias, la presión de la sangre contra las paredes de las arterias se llama presión arterial. Su presión arterial se da como dos números: presión arterial sistólica sobre diastólica. Su presión arterial sistólica es la presión arterial más alta durante el ciclo de latido de su corazón. Su presión arterial diastólica es la presión más baja.

Cuando su presión arterial está demasiado alta, pone estrés adicional en su corazón y vasos sanguíneos. Si su presión arterial se mantiene alta todo el tiempo, tendrá un mayor riesgo de ataques cardíacos y otras enfermedades vasculares (de los vasos sanguíneos), accidentes cerebrovasculares, enfermedad renal y otros problemas de salud.

A continuación se presentan preguntas que puede hacerle a su proveedor de atención médica para ayudarle a cuidar su presión arterial.

Preguntas
¿Cómo puedo cambiar mi forma de vida para bajar mi presión arterial?

• ¿Qué es una dieta saludable para el corazón? ¿Está bien comer algo que no sea saludable para el corazón alguna vez? ¿Cuáles son algunas formas de comer saludablemente cuando voy a un restaurante?
• ¿Necesito limitar la cantidad de sal que uso? ¿Hay otras especias que pueda usar para que mi comida tenga buen sabor?
• ¿Está bien beber alcohol? ¿Cuánto está bien?
• ¿Qué puedo hacer para dejar de fumar? ¿Está bien estar cerca de otras personas que están fumando?

¿Debería revisar mi presión arterial en casa?

            <div class='text-box original'>Low blood sugar - self-care

Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.

What is Low Blood Sugar?
Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.

You are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:

Insulin
Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)
You are also at increased risk of having low blood sugar if you have had previous low blood sugar levels.

Recognizing Low Blood Sugar
Know how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:

Weakness or feeling tired
Shaking
Sweating
Headache
Hunger
Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious
Feeling cranky
Trouble thinking clearly
Double or blurry vision
Fast or pounding heartbeat
Sometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:

Faint
Have a seizure
Go into a coma
Some people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.

Check Your Blood Sugar Often
Talk with your provider about when you should check your blood sugar every day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.

The most common causes of low blood sugar are:

Taking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time
Taking too much insul...</div>

La hipoglucemia es una condición que ocurre cuando su azúcar en sangre (glucosa) está más baja de lo normal. La hipoglucemia puede ocurrir en personas con diabetes que están tomando insulina u otros medicamentos para controlar su diabetes. La hipoglucemia puede causar síntomas peligrosos. Aprenda a reconocer los síntomas de la hipoglucemia y cómo prevenirlos.

¿Qué es la hipoglucemia?
La hipoglucemia se llama hipoglycemia en inglés. Un nivel de azúcar en sangre por debajo de 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) es bajo y puede dañarle. Un nivel de azúcar en sangre por debajo de 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) es motivo de acción inmediata.

Usted tiene riesgo de hipoglucemia si tiene diabetes y está tomando alguno de los siguientes medicamentos para la diabetes:

- Insulina
- Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin) o nateglinide (Starlix)

También tiene mayor riesgo de tener hipoglucemia si ha tenido niveles bajos de azúcar en sangre anteriormente.

Cómo reconocer la hipoglucemia
Sepa cómo saber cuándo su azúcar en sangre está bajando. Los síntomas incluyen:

- Debilidad o sensación de cansancio
- Temblores
- Sudoración
- Dolor de cabeza
- Hambre
- Sensación de inquietud, nerviosismo o ansiedad
- Irritabilidad
- Dificultad para pensar con claridad
- Visión doble o borrosa
- Latido cardíaco rápido o fuerte

A veces su azúcar en sangre puede estar demasiado baja incluso si no tiene síntomas. Si baja demasiado, puede:

- Desmayarse
- Tener convulsiones
- Entrar en coma

Algunas personas que han tenido diabetes durante mucho tiempo dejan de poder detectar la hipoglucemia. Esto se llama falta de conciencia de la hipoglucemia. Pregúntele a su proveedor de atención médica si usar un monitor continuo de glucosa y sensor puede ayudarle a detectar cuándo su azúcar en sangre está bajando demasiado para ayudar a prevenir los síntomas.

Asthma quick-relief medicines work fast to control asthma symptoms. You take them when you are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack. They are also called rescue medicines.

Many of these medicines are called "bronchodilators" because they open (dilate) and help relax the muscles of your airways (bronchi).

You and your health care provider can make a plan for the quick-relief medicines that work for you. This plan will include when you should take them and how much you should take.

Plan ahead. Make sure you do not run out. Bring enough medicine with you when you travel.

Short-acting Beta-agonists
Short-acting beta-agonists are the most common quick-relief medicines for treating asthma attacks and are considered to be bronchodilators.

They can be used just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise. They work by relaxing the muscles of your airways, and this lets you breathe better during an attack.

Tell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more to control your asthma symptoms. Your asthma may not be under control, and your provider may need to change your dose of daily control medicines.

Some quick-relief asthma medicines include:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline
Short-acting beta-agonists may cause these side effects:

Anxiety.
Fast and irregular heartbeats. Call your provider right away if you have this side effect.
Headache.
Restlessness.
Tremor (your hand or another part of your body may shake).
Oral Steroids
Your provider might prescribe oral steroids when you have an asthma attack that is not going away. These are medicines that you take by mouth as pills, capsules, or liquids.

Oral steroids are not quick-relief medicines but are often given for 7 to 14 days when your symptoms flare-up.

Oral steroids include:

Methylprednisolone
Prednisone

Los medicamentos de alivio rápido para el asma actúan rápidamente para controlar los síntomas del asma. Usted los toma cuando tiene tos, sibilancias, dificultad para respirar o un ataque de asma. También se llaman medicamentos de rescate.

Muchos de estos medicamentos se llaman "broncodilatadores" porque abren (dilatan) y ayudan a relajar los músculos de las vías respiratorias (bronquios).

Usted y su proveedor pueden hacer un plan con los medicamentos de alivio rápido que funcionen para usted. Este plan incluirá cuándo debe tomarlos y cuánto debe tomar.

Planifique con anticipación. Asegúrese de no quedarse sin medicamento. Lleve suficiente medicamento con usted cuando viaje.

Betaagonistas de acción corta
Los betaagonistas de acción corta son los medicamentos de alivio rápido más comunes para tratar los ataques de asma y se consideran broncodilatadores.

Se pueden usar justo antes de hacer ejercicio para ayudar a prevenir los síntomas del asma causados por el ejercicio. Funcionan relajando los músculos de las vías respiratorias, y esto le permite respirar mejor durante un ataque.

Informe a su proveedor si está usando medicamentos de alivio rápido dos veces por semana o más para controlar sus síntomas del asma. Es posible que su asma no esté bajo control y su proveedor pueda necesitar cambiar la dosis de sus medicamentos de control diarios.

Algunos medicamentos de alivio rápido para el asma incluyen:

• Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
• Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)

You were in the hospital after having a stroke. A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain stops.

At home follow your health care provider's instructions on self-care. Use the information below as a reminder.

When You're in the Hospital
First, you received treatment to prevent further damage to the brain, and to help the heart, lungs, and other important organs heal.

After you were stable, your providers did testing and started treatment to help you recover from the stroke and prevent a future stroke. You may have stayed in a special unit that helps people recover after a stroke.

What to Expect at Home
Because of possible injury to the brain from the stroke, you may notice problems with:

Changes in behavior
Doing easy tasks
Memory
Moving one side of the body
Muscle spasms
Paying attention
Sensation or awareness of one part of the body
Swallowing
Talking or understanding others
Thinking
Seeing to one side (hemianopsia)
You may need help with daily activities you used to do alone before the stroke. You may have physical or occupational therapy to restore your ability to perform these functions.

Depression after a stroke is fairly common as you learn to live with the changes. It may develop soon after the stroke or up to 2 years after the stroke.

Do not drive your car without your provider's permission.

Moving Around
Moving around and doing normal tasks may be hard after a stroke.

Make sure your home is safe. Ask your provider, therapist, or nurse about making changes in your home to make it easier to do everyday activities.

Find out about what you can do to prevent falls and keep your bathroom safe to use.

Family and caregivers may need to help with:

Exercises to keep your elbows, shoulders, and other joints loose
Watching for joint tightening (contractures)
Making sure splints are used in the correct way
Making sure arms and legs are in a good position when sitting or lying
If you or your loved one is using a wheelchair, fol...</div>

Usted estuvo en el hospital después de sufrir un accidente cerebrovascular. Un accidente cerebrovascular ocurre cuando el flujo sanguíneo a una parte del cerebro se detiene.

En casa, siga las instrucciones de su proveedor de atención médica sobre el cuidado personal. Use la información a continuación como recordatorio.

Cuando estuvo en el hospital
Primero, recibió tratamiento para prevenir más daño al cerebro y para ayudar al corazón, los pulmones y otros órganos importantes a sanar.

Después de que estuvo estable, sus proveedores realizaron pruebas e iniciaron tratamiento para ayudarle a recuperarse del accidente cerebrovascular y prevenir uno futuro. Es posible que se haya quedado en una unidad especial que ayuda a las personas a recuperarse después de un accidente cerebrovascular.

Qué esperar en casa
Debido a una posible lesión en el cerebro causada por el accidente cerebrovascular, puede notar problemas con:

• Cambios en el comportamiento
• Realizar tareas sencillas
• Memoria
• Mover un lado del cuerpo
• Espasmos musculares
• Prestar atención
• Sensación o conciencia de una parte del cuerpo
• Tragar
• Hablar o comprender a otros
• Pensar
• Ver hacia un lado (hemianopsia)

Puede necesitar ayuda con las actividades diarias que solía hacer solo antes del accidente cerebrovascular. Puede que necesite terapia física u ocupacional para recuperar su capacidad de realizar estas funciones.

La depresión después de un accidente cerebrovascular es bastante común a medida que aprende a vivir con los cambios. Puede desarrollarse poco después del accidente cerebrovascular o hasta 2 años después.

No conduzca su automóvil sin el permiso de su proveedor.

Moverse
Moverse y realizar tareas normales puede ser difícil después de un accidente cerebrovascular.

Asegúrese de que su hogar sea seguro. Pregúntele a su proveedor, terapeuta o enfermera sobre hacer cambios en su hogar para facilitar las actividades cotidianas.

            <div class='text-box original'>Surgical wound care - open

An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the kind of surgery you had.

Sometimes, an incision breaks open. This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).

What to Expect at Home
If your surgeon does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. A dressing helps absorb drainage and keep the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.

Proper Handwashing
It is important to clean your hands before you change your dressing. You can use an alcohol-based cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands using these steps:

Take all jewelry off your hands.
Wet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.
Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or the "Alphabet Song" one time through). Clean under your nails also.
Rinse well.
Dry with a clean towel.
Removing the Old Dressing
Your health care provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. To prepare for the dressing change:

Clean your hands before touching the dressing.
Make sure you have all the supplies handy.
Have a clean work surface.
Remove the old dressing:

Carefully loosen the tape from your skin.
Use a clean (not sterile) medical glove to grab the old dressing and pull it off.
If the dressing sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your provider instructed you to pull it off dry.
Put the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.
Clean your hands again after you take off the old dressing.
Caring for the Wound
You may use a gauze pad or soft cloth to clean the skin around your wound:

Use a normal saline solution (salt water) or mild soapy water.
Soak the gauze or cloth in the saline solutio...</div>

            <div class='text-box translated'>Cuidado de la herida quirúrgica - abierta

Una incisión es un corte en la piel que se realiza durante una cirugía. También se llama herida quirúrgica. Algunas incisiones son pequeñas, otras son largas. El tamaño de la incisión depende del tipo de cirugía que tuvo.

A veces, una incisión se abre. Esto puede ocurrir a lo largo de todo el corte o solo en una parte. Su cirujano puede decidir no volver a cerrarla con suturas (puntos).

Qué esperar en casa

Si su cirujano no vuelve a cerrar su herida con suturas, necesita cuidarla en casa, ya que puede tomar tiempo sanar. La herida sanará de abajo hacia arriba. Una venda ayuda a absorber el drenaje y evita que la piel se cierre antes de que la herida de abajo se llene.

Lavado adecuado de manos

Es importante limpiar sus manos antes de cambiar la venda. Puede usar un limpiador a base de alcohol. O puede lavarse las manos siguiendo estos pasos:

1. Quítese todas las joyas de las manos.
2. Moje sus manos, apuntándolas hacia abajo bajo agua corriente tibia.
3. Agregue jabón y lávese las manos durante 15 a 30 segundos (cante "Feliz Cumpleaños" o el "Abecedario" una vez completa). Limpie debajo de las uñas también.
4. Enjuague bien.
5. Séquese con una toalla limpia.

Retirar la venda vieja

Su proveedor de atención médica le dirá con qué frecuencia cambiar la venda. Para prepararse para el cambio de venda:

- Limpie sus manos antes de tocar la venda.
- Asegúrese de tener todos los suministros a la mano.
- Tenga una superficie de trabajo limpia.

Retire la venda vieja:

- Afloje cuidadosamente la cinta de la piel.
- Use un guante médico limpio (no estéril) para agarrar la venda vieja y retirarla.
- Si la venda se pega a la herida, mójela e intente de nuevo, a menos que su proveedor le haya indicado que se la quite en seco.
- Coloque la venda vieja en una bolsa de plástico y déjela a un lado.
- Limpie sus manos nuevamente después de quitarse la venda vieja.

- Use a clean medical glove (non-sterile) to grab the old bandage and remove it.
- If the bandage sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your provider has indicated that you remove it dry.
- Place the old bandage in a plastic bag and leave it to one side.

You had surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint called a prosthesis. This article tells you what you need to do to care for your new hip when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You had a hip joint replacement surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.

What to Expect at Home
By the time you go home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without needing much help. Most people do not need them after 2 to 4 weeks. Check with your surgeon about when to stop using crutches.

You should also be able to dress yourself with only a little help and be able to get into and out of your bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help.

You will need to be careful that you do not dislocate your artificial hip, especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions.

You will need to have someone with you at home for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehab center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.

Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.

Home Setup
Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You may not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.

Keep tripping hazards out of your home.

Usted deberá tener cuidado de no dislocar su cadera artificial, especialmente en los primeros meses después de la cirugía. Deberá aprender ejercicios que hagan su nueva cadera más fuerte y tomar precauciones especiales.

Usted necesitará tener a alguien con usted en casa durante 1 a 2 semanas después de salir del hospital o del centro de rehabilitación. Necesitará ayuda para preparar las comidas, bañarse, moverse por la casa y hacer otras actividades diarias.

Con el tiempo, debería poder regresar a su nivel de actividad anterior. Deberá evitar algunos deportes, como el esquí alpino o deportes de contacto como el fútbol americano y el fútbol. Pero debería poder hacer actividades de bajo impacto, como caminar por senderos, jardinería, nadar, jugar tenis y golf.
