            <div class='text-box original'>Heart Failure - Discharge

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is no longer able to pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body efficiently. When symptoms become severe, a hospital stay may be necessary. This article discusses what you need to do to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You were in the hospital to have your heart failure treated. Heart failure occurs when the muscles of your heart are weak or have trouble relaxing, or both.

Your heart is a pump that moves fluids through your body. As with any pump, if the flow out of the pump is not enough, fluids do not move well and they get stuck in places they should not be. In your body, this means that fluid collects in your lungs, abdomen, and legs.

While you were in the hospital:
Your health care team closely adjusted the fluids you drank or received through an intravenous (IV) line. They also watched and measured how much urine you produced.
You may have received medicines to help your body get rid of extra fluids.
You may have had tests to check how well your heart was working.

What to Expect at Home
Your energy will slowly return. You may need help taking care of yourself when you first get home. You may feel sad or depressed. All of these things are normal.

Checking Yourself at Home
Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale when you get up -- before you eat but after you use the bathroom. Make sure you are wearing similar clothing each time you weigh yourself. Write down your weight every day on a chart so that you can keep track of it.

Throughout the day, ask yourself:
Is my energy level normal?
Do I get more short of breath when I am doing my everyday activities?
Are my clothes or shoes feeling tight?
Are my ankles or legs swelling?
Am I coughing more often? Does my cough sound wet?
Do I get short of breath at night or when I lie down?

If you are having new (or different) symptoms, ask yourself:

Did I eat something different than usua...</div>

Heart failure se yon maladi kote kè a pa kapab ponpe san ki rich an oksijèn ale nan rès kò a byen ankò. Lè sentòm yo vin grav, ou ka bezwen rete lopital. Atik sa a esplike sa ou bezwen fè pou pran swen tèt ou lè ou kite lopital la.

Lè Ou nan Lopital
Ou te nan lopital pou yo te trete heart failure ou. Heart failure rive lè misk kè ou yo fèb oswa yo gen difikilte pou yo detann, oswa toude ansanm.

Kè ou se yon ponp ki fè likid sikile nan tout kò ou. Menm jan ak nenpòt ponp, si kantite likid ki soti nan ponp lan pa sifi, likid yo pa sikile byen epi yo bloke nan kote yo pa dwe ye. Nan kò ou, sa vle di likid ap rasanble nan poumon ou, nan vant ou, ak nan janm ou.

Pandan ou te nan lopital:
Ekip swen sante ou a te kontwole anpil likid ou te bwè oswa ou te resevwa nan venn (intravenous, IV). Yo te veye epi mezire konbyen pipi ou t ap fè.
Yo ka te ba ou medikaman pou ede kò ou jete likid anplis.
Yo ka te fè tès pou verifye kijan kè ou t ap travay.

Sa pou Ou Atann Lakay
Enèji ou ap retounen piti piti. Ou ka bezwen èd pou pran swen tèt ou lè ou fèk rive lakay ou. Ou ka santi ou tris oswa dekouraje. Tout bagay sa yo nòmal.

Kontwole Tèt Ou Lakay
Peze tèt ou chak maten sou menm balans lan lè ou leve -- anvan ou manje men apre ou fin ale twalèt. Asire ou mete menm kalite rad chak fwa ou peze tèt ou. Ekri pwa ou chak jou sou yon tablo pou ou ka swiv li.

Pandan jounen an, poze tèt ou kesyon sa yo:
Èske nivo enèji mwen nòmal?
Èske mwen vin pi fasil souf kout lè m ap fè aktivite m fè chak jou yo?
Èske rad oswa soulye mwen yo vin sere?
Èske cheviy oswa janm mwen ap anfle?
Èske mwen ap touse pi souvan? Èske tous mwen an sonnen mouye?
Èske mwen vin souf kout lannwit oswa lè m kouche?

Si ou gen nouvo sentòm (oswa sentòm yo chanje), poze tèt ou kesyon sa yo:

Èske mwen te manje yon bagay diferan pase sa m abitye manje oswa mwen te eseye yon nouvo manje?
Èske mwen pran tout medikaman mwen yo jan yo te di m la, nan bon lè yo?

When You are in the Hospital  
You were in the hospital so they could treat your heart failure. Heart failure happens when your heart muscles are weak or have difficulty relaxing, or both together.

Your heart is a pump that makes fluid circulate throughout your body. Just like any pump, if the amount of fluid that comes out of the pump is not enough, the fluids do not circulate well and they get stuck in places they should not be.

            <div class='text-box original'>Taking warfarin

Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told. Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines with it or at different times, and eating certain foods can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

What to Expect at Home
Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. This may be important if:

You have already had blood clots in your leg, arm, heart, or brain.
Your health care provider is worried that a blood clot may form in your body. People who have a new heart valve, a large heart, a heart rhythm that is not normal, or other heart problems may need to take warfarin.
When you are taking warfarin, you may be more likely to bleed, even from activities you have always done.

Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines, and eating certain foods all can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form blood clots. It is very important for you to take warfarin exactly as you were told to take it.

You have already had blood clots in your leg, your arm, your heart, or in your brain.  
Your health care provider (your doctor or other health professional) is afraid that a blood clot may form in your body. People who have a new heart valve, an enlarged heart, an abnormal heartbeat, or other heart problems may need to take warfarin.  
When you are taking warfarin, you may be more likely to bleed, even during activities you have always done.

When your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the pressure of the blood against the artery walls is called your blood pressure.

            <div class='text-box back-translated'>High blood pressure - what to ask your doctor

When your heart is pumping blood into your arteries, the pressure the blood makes on the lining of the arteries is called blood pressure. They give your blood pressure in the form of two (2) numbers: systolic blood pressure over diastolic blood pressure. Your systolic blood pressure is the highest pressure while your heart is beating. Your diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure.

When your blood pressure becomes too high, it puts more stress on your heart and your blood vessels. If your blood pressure stays high all the time, you will have more risk of having a heart attack and other vascular (blood vessel) diseases, stroke (attack in the brain), kidney disease, and other health problems.

Below here, there are some questions you can ask your healthcare professional to help you take care of your blood pressure.

Questions
How can I change the way I live to lower my blood pressure?

*   What is a diet that is good for the heart? Is it OK for me to eat something that is not good for my heart sometimes? What are some ways I can eat healthy when I go to a restaurant?
*   Do I need to limit the amount of salt I use? Are there other spices I can use to make my food taste good?

Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.

What is Low Blood Sugar?
Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.

You are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:

Insulin
Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)
You are also at increased risk of having low blood sugar if you have had previous low blood sugar levels.

Recognizing Low Blood Sugar
Know how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:

Weakness or feeling tired
Shaking
Sweating
Headache
Hunger
Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious
Feeling cranky
Trouble thinking clearly
Double or blurry vision
Fast or pounding heartbeat
Sometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:

Faint
Have a seizure
Go into a coma
Some people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.

Check Your Blood Sugar Often
Talk with your provider about when you should check your blood sugar every day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.

The most common causes of low blood sugar are:

Taking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time
Taking too much insul...</div>

Asthma quick-relief medicines work fast to control asthma symptoms. You take them when you are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack. They are also called rescue medicines.

Many of these medicines are called "bronchodilators" because they open (dilate) and help relax the muscles of your airways (bronchi).

You and your health care provider can make a plan for the quick-relief medicines that work for you. This plan will include when you should take them and how much you should take.

Plan ahead. Make sure you do not run out. Bring enough medicine with you when you travel.

Short-acting Beta-agonists
Short-acting beta-agonists are the most common quick-relief medicines for treating asthma attacks and are considered to be bronchodilators.

They can be used just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise. They work by relaxing the muscles of your airways, and this lets you breathe better during an attack.

Tell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more to control your asthma symptoms. Your asthma may not be under control, and your provider may need to change your dose of daily control medicines.

Some quick-relief asthma medicines include:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline
Short-acting beta-agonists may cause these side effects:

Anxiety.
Fast and irregular heartbeats. Call your provider right away if you have this side effect.
Headache.
Restlessness.
Tremor (your hand or another part of your body may shake).
Oral Steroids
Your provider might prescribe oral steroids when you have an asthma attack that is not going away. These are medicines that you take by mouth as pills, capsules, or liquids.

Oral steroids are not quick-relief medicines but are often given for 7 to 14 days when your symptoms flare-up.

Oral steroids include:

Methylprednisolone
Prednisone

Medikaman soulajman rapid pou opresyon (asthma) aji vit pou kontwole sentòm opresyon yo. Ou pran yo lè ou ap touse, ou gen souf kout, ou gen difikilte pou respire, oswa lè ou ap fè yon kriz opresyon. Yo rele yo tou medikaman sekou.

Anpil nan medikaman sa yo rele "bronchodilators" paske yo louvri (dilate) epi yo ede detann misk ki nan pasaj lè ou yo (bronchi).

Ou menm ak founisè swen sante ou ka fè yon plan pou medikaman soulajman rapid ki mache pou ou. Plan sa a ap gen ladan ki lè ou dwe pran yo epi konbyen ou dwe pran.

Planifye davans. Asire w ou pa janm fini medikaman ou. Pran ase medikaman avè w lè w ap vwayaje.

Beta-agonists ki aji kout (Short-acting Beta-agonists)
Beta-agonists ki aji kout se medikaman soulajman rapid ki pi souvan yo itilize pou trete kriz opresyon epi yo konsidere kòm bronchodilators.

Yo ka itilize jis anvan ou fè egzèsis pou ede anpeche sentòm opresyon ki koze pa egzèsis. Yo mache lè yo detann misk ki nan pasaj lè ou yo, epi sa pèmèt ou respire pi byen pandan yon kriz.

Di founisè ou si ou ap itilize medikaman soulajman rapid de fwa pa semèn oswa plis pou kontwole sentòm opresyon ou yo. Sa ka vle di opresyon ou pa byen kontwole, epi founisè ou ka bezwen chanje dòz medikaman ou pran chak jou pou kontwòl.

Kèk medikaman soulajman rapid pou opresyon gen ladan:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline
Beta-agonists ki aji kout ka bay efè segondè sa yo:

Anksyete.
Batman kè rapid ak iregilye. Rele founisè ou touswit si ou gen efè segondè sa a.
Maltèt.
Ajitasyon (ou santi w pa ka rete an plas).
Tremor (men ou oswa yon lòt pati nan kò ou ka tranble).

Founisè ou ka preskri estewoyid oral lè ou gen yon kriz opresyon ki pa pase. Sa yo se medikaman ou pran nan bouch tankou grenn, kapsil, oswa likid.

Short-acting beta-agonists are the quick-relief medicines most often used to treat asthma attacks and are considered bronchodilators.

They can be used just before you exercise to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise. They work by relaxing the muscles in your air passages, and this allows you to breathe better during an attack.

Tell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicine two times a week or more to control your asthma symptoms. This may mean your asthma is not well controlled, and your provider may need to change the dose of the medicine you take every day for control.

Some quick-relief medicines for asthma include:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline
Short-acting beta-agonists can give these side effects:

Anxiety.
Fast and irregular heartbeat. Call your provider right away if you have this side effect.
Headache.
Agitation (you feel you cannot stay still).
Tremor (your hands or another part of your body may shake).
Oral steroids

These medicines treat high blood pressure, stroke, or heart attack. They can help reduce the risk of you having a stroke or a heart attack.

They are also used to treat kidney problems. This can help prevent your kidneys from getting worse or even improve your kidney function, especially if you have sugar (diabetes). If you have these problems, ask your healthcare professional if you should take these medicines.

Types of ACE inhibitors
There are many different names and brands for ACE inhibitors. Most of them work the same way. The side effects can be different for each medicine.

How to take your ACE inhibitors
ACE inhibitors are pills you take by mouth. Take all your medicines as your healthcare professional told you. Go see your healthcare professional regularly. Your healthcare professional will check your blood pressure and will do blood tests to ensure the medicines are working well. Your healthcare professional may change the dose from time to time. In addition to that:

*   Try to take your medicines at the same time every day.
*   Do not stop taking your medicines without speaking with your healthcare professional first.
*   Plan ahead so medicine does not run out on you. Ensure you have enough medicine with you when you are traveling.
*   Before you take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or aspirin, speak with your healthcare professional.
*   Tell your healthcare professional what other medicines you are taking, such as anything you buy without a prescription, diuretics (water pills), potassiu...</div>

An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the kind of surgery you had.

Sometimes, an incision breaks open. This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).

What to Expect at Home
If your surgeon does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. A dressing helps absorb drainage and keep the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.

Proper Handwashing
It is important to clean your hands before you change your dressing. You can use an alcohol-based cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands using these steps:

Take all jewelry off your hands.
Wet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.
Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or the "Alphabet Song" one time through). Clean under your nails also.
Rinse well.
Dry with a clean towel.
Removing the Old Dressing
Your health care provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. To prepare for the dressing change:

Clean your hands before touching the dressing.
Make sure you have all the supplies handy.
Have a clean work surface.
Remove the old dressing:

Carefully loosen the tape from your skin.
Use a clean (not sterile) medical glove to grab the old dressing and pull it off.
If the dressing sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your provider instructed you to pull it off dry.
Put the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.
Clean your hands again after you take off the old dressing.
Caring for the Wound
You may use a gauze pad or soft cloth to clean the skin around your wound:

Use a normal saline solution (salt water) or mild soapy water.
Soak the gauze or cloth in the saline solutio...</div>

Yon ensizyon se yon koupe sou po a yo fè pandan operasyon. Yo rele li tou yon blesi chirijikal. Gen kèk ensizyon ki piti, gen lòt ki long. Gwosè ensizyon an depann de kalite operasyon ou te fè a.

Si chirijyen ou pa fèmen blesi ou ankò ak sutur, ou bezwen okipe l lakay ou, paske li ka pran tan pou li geri. Blesi a ap geri apati fon an pou rive anlè. Yon pansman ede absòbe likid ki soti epi li anpeche po a fèmen anvan blesi ki anba a fin ranpli.

Lave Men Kòrèkteman
Li enpòtan pou ou netwaye men ou anvan ou chanje pansman an. Ou ka itilize yon netwayan ki gen alkòl. Oswa, ou ka lave men ou lè w swiv etap sa yo:

Retire tout bijou nan men ou.
Mouye men ou, kenbe yo desann anba dlo tyèd k ap koule.
Mete savon epi lave men ou pandan 15 a 30 segonn (chanje "Happy Birthday" oswa "Alphabet Song" la yon sèl fwa). Netwaye anba zong ou tou.
Rense byen.
Sèvi ak yon sèvyèt pwòp pou siye men ou.
Retire Vye Pansman an
Founisè swen sante ou ap di ou konbyen fwa pou chanje pansman an. Pou prepare w pou chanjman pansman an:

Netwaye men ou anvan ou manyen pansman an.
Asire w ou gen tout materyèl ou bezwen yo bò kote ou.
Gen yon sifas travay ki pwòp.
Retire vye pansman an:

Dekole tep la dousman sou po ou.
Sèvi ak yon gan medikal pwòp (ki pa nesesèman esteril) pou pran vye pansman an epi rale l.
Si pansman an kole sou blesi a, mouye l epi eseye ankò, sòf si founisè ou te di ou pou rale l sèk.

Wash Hands Correctly  
It is important for you to clean your hands before you change the dressing. You can use an alcohol-based cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands by following these steps:

Remove all jewelry from your hands.  
Wet your hands, holding them down under warm running water.  
Apply soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing the “Happy Birthday” or “Alphabet Song” once). Clean under your nails as well.  
Rinse well.  
Use a clean towel to dry your hands.

Remove the Old Dressing  
Your health care provider will tell you how often to change the dressing. To prepare yourself for the dressing change:

Clean your hands before you touch the dressing.  
Make sure you have all the supplies you need next to you.  
Have a clean work surface.

Remove the old dressing:

Gently peel the tape off your skin.  
Use a clean medical glove (not necessarily sterile) to pick up the old dressing and pull it off.  
If the dressing is stuck to the wound, moisten it and try again, unless your provider told you to pull it off dry.  
Place the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.  
Clean your hands again after you remove the old dressing.

You had surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint called a prosthesis. This article tells you what you need to do to care for your new hip when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You had a hip joint replacement surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.

What to Expect at Home
By the time you go home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without needing much help. Most people do not need them after 2 to 4 weeks. Check with your surgeon about when to stop using crutches.

You should also be able to dress yourself with only a little help and be able to get into and out of your bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help.

You will need to be careful that you do not dislocate your artificial hip, especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions.

You will need to have someone with you at home for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehab center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.

Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.

Home Setup
Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You may not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.

Keep tripping hazards out of your home.

You should be able to dress yourself with only a little help and be able to get into your bed or a chair and get out on your own. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help.

You will need to be careful not to dislocate your artificial hip, especially in the first months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions.

You will need to have someone with you at home for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehabilitation center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.

With time, you should be able to return to your previous level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports such as American football and soccer. But you should be able to do low-impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and playing golf.

Home Arrangements
Your bed should be low enough so that your feet can touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hip is higher than your knee when you sit on the edge. You may not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.

**Lè Ou Lopital la**
Ou te fè yon operasyon ranplasman jwenti ranch pou ranplase tout oswa yon pati nan jwenti ranch ou avèk yon jwenti atifisyèl. Jwenti atifisyèl sa a rele yon pwotèz.

**Sa pou Ou Atann Lakay**
Lè lè a rive pou ou ale lakay, ou ta dwe kapab mache avèk yon kad pou mache (walker) oswa beki san ou pa bezwen anpil èd. Pifò moun pa bezwen yo apre 2 a 4 semèn. Mande chirijyen w lan ki lè pou ou sispann itilize beki.

Ou ta dwe kapab abiye tèt ou tou avèk sèlman yon ti kras èd epi ou ta dwe kapab monte ak desann kabann ou oswa yon chèz poukont ou. Ou ta dwe kapab itilize twalèt la tou san anpil èd.

Ou pral bezwen fè atansyon pou ranch atifisyèl ou a pa soti nan plas li (pa deplase), sitou nan premye mwa yo apre operasyon an. Ou pral bezwen aprann egzèsis ki fè nouvo ranch ou a pi solid epi pran prekosyon espesyal.

Ou pral bezwen gen yon moun avèk ou lakay ou pou 1 a 2 semèn apre ou kite lopital la oswa sant reyabilitasyon an. Ou pral bezwen èd pou prepare manje, benyen, deplase nan kay la, ak fè lòt aktivite chak jou.

**Aranjman nan Kay la**
Kabann ou ta dwe ba ase pou pye ou touche atè lè ou chita sou bò kabann nan. Kabann ou ta dwe wo ase tou pou ranch ou pi wo pase jenou ou lè ou chita sou bò a. Ou gendwa pa bezwen yon kabann lopital, men matla ou ta dwe fèm.

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is no longer able to pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body efficiently. When symptoms become severe, a hospital stay may be necessary. This article discusses what you need to do to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You were in the hospital to have your heart failure treated. Heart failure occurs when the muscles of your heart are weak or have trouble relaxing, or both.

Your heart is a pump that moves fluids through your body. As with any pump, if the flow out of the pump is not enough, fluids do not move well and they get stuck in places they should not be. In your body, this means that fluid collects in your lungs, abdomen, and legs.

While you were in the hospital:
Your health care team closely adjusted the fluids you drank or received through an intravenous (IV) line. They also watched and measured how much urine you produced.
You may have received medicines to help your body get rid of extra fluids.
You may have had tests to check how well your heart was working.

What to Expect at Home
Your energy will slowly return. You may need help taking care of yourself when you first get home. You may feel sad or depressed. All of these things are normal.

Checking Yourself at Home
Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale when you get up -- before you eat but after you use the bathroom. Make sure you are wearing similar clothing each time you weigh yourself. Write down your weight every day on a chart so that you can keep track of it.

Throughout the day, ask yourself:
Is my energy level normal?
Do I get more short of breath when I am doing my everyday activities?
Are my clothes or shoes feeling tight?
Are my ankles or legs swelling?
Am I coughing more often? Does my cough sound wet?
Do I get short of breath at night or when I lie down?

If you are having new (or different) symptoms, ask yourself:

Lè w Te Lopital

Ou te lopital pou yo trete fèyak kè ou. Fèyak kè rive lè misk kè ou yo fèb oswa yo gen difikilte pou detann, oswa tou de.

Kè ou se yon pòm ki fè likid deplase nan kò w. Tankou nenpòt pòm, si kantite likid ki soti nan pòm an pa ase, likid yo pa deplase byen epi yo rete kote yo pa ta dwe rete. Nan kò w, sa vle di ke likid kolekte nan poumòn ou, vant ou, ak janm ou.

Pandan w te lopital la:
- Ekip swen sante ou te ajiste ak anpil atansyon likid ou te bwè oswa ou te resevwa nan yon liy intravenin (IV). Yo te tou veye e mezi kantite pipi ou te fè.
- Ou ka te resevwa medikaman pou ede kò w yo debarase twòp likid.
- Ou ka te fè tès pou verifye kijan kè ou t ap travay.

Sa pou w Atann Lakay Ou

Enèji w ap retounen gradyèlman. Ou ka bezwen èd pou pran swen tèt ou lè w fèk rive lakay. Ou ka santi w tris oswa deprime. Tout sa yo se bagay ki nòmal.

Kijan pou w Tcheke Tèt Ou Lakay

Prize tèt ou chak maten sou menm balans la lè w leve -- anvan w manje men apre w fin itilize twalèt la. Asire w ke w ap mete rad ki sanble chak fè w ap peze tèt ou. Ekri pwa w chak jou sou yon fèy pou w ka swiv li.

Pandan tout jounen an, mande tèt ou:
- Èske nivo enèji m nòmal?
- Èske m gen plis difikilte pou respire lè m ap fè aktivite chak jou mwen yo?
- Èske rad mwen oswa soulye mwen ap santi yo sere?
- Èske cheville mwen yo oswa janm mwen yo ap fè anfle?
- Èske m ap tous pi souvan? Èske tous mwen an santi l mouye?
- Èske m gen difikilte pou respire lannwit oswa lè m kouche?

Si w ap gen siyòm nouvo (oswa diferan), mande tèt ou:
- Èske m te manje yon bagay ki diferan pase dabitid oswa m te eseye yon nouvo manje?
- Èske m te pran tout medikaman mwen yo nan bon jan de fwa ak lè yo?

When your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the pressure of the blood against the artery walls is called your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is given as two numbers: systolic over diastolic blood pressure. Your systolic blood pressure is the highest blood pressure during the course of your heart beat cycle. Your diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure.

When your blood pressure gets too high, it puts extra stress on your heart and blood vessels. If your blood pressure stays high all the time, you will be at a higher risk for heart attacks and other vascular (blood vessel) diseases, strokes, kidney disease, and other health problems.

Below are questions you may want to ask your health care provider to help you take care of your blood pressure.

Questions
How can I change the way I live to lower my blood pressure?

What is a heart-healthy diet? Is it OK to ever eat something that is not heart healthy? What are some ways to eat healthy when I go to a restaurant?
Do I need to limit how much salt I use? Are there other spices that I can use to make my food taste good?
Is it OK to drink alcohol? How much is OK?

Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.

What is Low Blood Sugar?
Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.

You are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:

Insulin
Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)
You are also at increased risk of having low blood sugar if you have had previous low blood sugar levels.

Recognizing Low Blood Sugar
Know how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:

Weakness or feeling tired
Shaking
Sweating
Headache
Hunger
Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious
Feeling cranky
Trouble thinking clearly
Double or blurry vision
Fast or pounding heartbeat
Sometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:

Faint
Have a seizure
Go into a coma
Some people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.

Check Your Blood Sugar Often
Talk with your provider about when you should check your blood sugar every day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.

The most common causes of low blood sugar are:

Taking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time
Taking too much insul...</div>

Sik ki ba se kisa?

Sik ki ba yo rele ipoglisemi. Yon nivo sik ki anba 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) se sik ki ba epi li ka fè ou mal. Yon nivo sik ki anba 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) se yon rezon pou aksyon imedyat.

Ou gen risk pou sik ki ba si ou gen dyabet epi w ap prè nenpòt nan medikaman dyabet sa yo ki annapre yo:

- Enstilèn
- Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), oswa nateglinide (Starlix)
- Ou gen risk pi gwo pou gen sik ki ba tou si ou te gen nivo sik ki ba anvan.

Rekonèt Sik ki ba

Konnen kijan pou w di lè sik ou ap vin ba. Sentòm yo enkli:

- Fèb oswa santi w fatige
- Trembleman
- Transpirasyon
- Maltèt
- Grangou
- Santi w mal alèz, nerveu, oswa ankyete
- Santi w irite
- Pa ka panse byen klè
- De vi oswa vi ki flou
- Kè bat vit oswa fò

Pafwa sik ou ka twò ba menm si ou pa gen sentòm. Si li vin twò ba, ou ka:

- Pèdi konesans
- Gen yon kriz (konvulsyon)
- Tonbe nan koma

Gen kèk moun ki gen dyabet depi lontan ki pa kapab santi lè sik yo ap vin ba ankò. Yo rele sa ipoglisemi ki pa gen sentòm. Mande founisè swen sante w si li posib pou ou mete yon aparèy pou kontwole sik la kontinyèlman ak yon sansè ki ka ede w detekte lè sik ou ap vin twò ba pou ka ede anpeche sentòm yo.

Asthma quick-relief medicines work fast to control asthma symptoms. You take them when you are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack. They are also called rescue medicines.

Many of these medicines are called "bronchodilators" because they open (dilate) and help relax the muscles of your airways (bronchi).

You and your health care provider can make a plan for the quick-relief medicines that work for you. This plan will include when you should take them and how much you should take.

Plan ahead. Make sure you do not run out. Bring enough medicine with you when you travel.

Short-acting Beta-agonists
Short-acting beta-agonists are the most common quick-relief medicines for treating asthma attacks and are considered to be bronchodilators.

They can be used just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise. They work by relaxing the muscles of your airways, and this lets you breathe better during an attack.

Tell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more to control your asthma symptoms. Your asthma may not be under control, and your provider may need to change your dose of daily control medicines.

Some quick-relief asthma medicines include:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline
Short-acting beta-agonists may cause these side effects:

Anxiety.
Fast and irregular heartbeats. Call your provider right away if you have this side effect.
Headache.
Restlessness.
Tremor (your hand or another part of your body may shake).
Oral Steroids
Your provider might prescribe oral steroids when you have an asthma attack that is not going away. These are medicines that you take by mouth as pills, capsules, or liquids.

Oral steroids are not quick-relief medicines but are often given for 7 to 14 days when your symptoms flare-up.

Oral steroids include:

Methylprednisolone
Prednisone

Asma - medikaman ki soulaje rapidman

Medikaman rapid pou asma yo ap travay rapidman pou kontwole sentòm asma yo. Ou pran yo lè w ap touse, lè w ap sifle, lè w gen difikilte pou respire, oswa lè w ap gen yon kriz asma. Yo rele tou medikaman sekou.

Anpil nan medikaman sa yo rele "bronkodilatatè" paske yo ouvè (dilate) epi ede relaks misk nan voies respiratoires ou yo (bronchi).

Ou ak founisè swen sante ou ka fè yon plan pou medikaman rapid yo ki ap travay pou ou. Plan sa a pral enkli lè ou dwe pran yo ak konbyen ou dwe pran.

Planifye davans. Asire w pa fini yo. Pote ase medikaman avèk ou lè w ap vwayaje.

Beta-agoniste ki ap travay rapidman

Beta-agoniste ki ap travay rapidman yo se medikaman rapid ki pi komen pou tretman kriz asma epi yo konsidere kòm bronkodilatatè.

Yo ka itilize jis anvan fè egzèsis pou ede anpeche sentòm asma ki lakòz pa egzèsis. Yo travay pa relaks misk nan voies respiratoires ou yo, e sa kite w respire pi byen pandan yon kriz.

Di founisè ou si w ap itilize medikaman rapid yo de fwa pa semèn oswa plis pou kontwole sentòm asma ou. Asma ou petèt pa anba kontwòl, e founisè ou ka bezwen chanje dòz medikaman kontwòl chak jou ou yo.

Gen kèk medikaman rapid pou asma ki enkli:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline

Beta-agoniste ki ap travay rapidman ka lakòz efè segondè sa yo:

Anksyete.
Kè ki bat vit e iregilye. Rele founisè ou tout de suite si w gen efè segondè sa a.
Mal tèt.
Pa ka poze.
Trembleman (men ou oswa yon lòt pati nan kò ou ka trenble).

Esteròd oral

Founisè ou ka preskri esteròd oral lè w gen yon kriz asma ki pa ap ale. Sa yo se medikaman ou pran pa bouch sou fòm konprime, kapsul, oswa likid.

Esteròd oral yo pa medikaman rapid men yo souvan bay pou 7 a 14 jou lè sentòm ou yo ap flanbe.

Esteròd oral yo enkli:

            <div class='text-box back-translated'>Asthma - medications that relieve quickly

Rapid medications for asthma work quickly to control the symptoms of asthma. You take them when you are coughing, when you are wheezing, when you have difficulty breathing, or when you are having an asthma crisis. They are also called rescue medications.

Many of these medications are called "bronchodilators" because they open (dilate) and help relax muscles in your respiratory airways (bronchi).

You and your health care provider can make a plan for the rapid medications that work for you. This plan will include when you should take them and how many you should take.

Plan ahead. Make sure you don't finish them. Bring enough medications with you when you are traveling.

Rapid-acting beta-agonists

Rapid-acting beta-agonists are the most common rapid medications for treatment of asthma crisis and they are considered as bronchodilators.

They can be used just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms that are caused by exercise. They work by relaxing muscles in your respiratory airways, and that lets you breathe better during a crisis.

Tell your provider if you are using the rapid medications twice per week or more to control your asthma symptoms. Your asthma perhaps not under control, and your provider may need to change the dose of your daily control medications.

There are some rapid medications for asthma that include:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline

Rapid-acting beta-agonists can cause these side effects:

Anxiety.
Heart that beats fast and irregularly. Call your provider right away if you have this side effect.
Headache.
Cannot rest.
Trembling (your hands or another part of your body may tremble).

Oral steroids

Your provider may prescribe oral steroids when you have an asthma crisis that is not going away. These are medications you take by mouth in the form of tablets, capsules, or liquid.

Oral steroids are not rapid medications but...</div>

            <div class='text-box original'>Surgical wound care - open

An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the kind of surgery you had.

Sometimes, an incision breaks open. This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).

What to Expect at Home
If your surgeon does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. A dressing helps absorb drainage and keep the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.

Proper Handwashing
It is important to clean your hands before you change your dressing. You can use an alcohol-based cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands using these steps:

Take all jewelry off your hands.
Wet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.
Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or the "Alphabet Song" one time through). Clean under your nails also.
Rinse well.
Dry with a clean towel.
Removing the Old Dressing
Your health care provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. To prepare for the dressing change:

Clean your hands before touching the dressing.
Make sure you have all the supplies handy.
Have a clean work surface.
Remove the old dressing:

Carefully loosen the tape from your skin.
Use a clean (not sterile) medical glove to grab the old dressing and pull it off.
If the dressing sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your provider instructed you to pull it off dry.
Put the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.
Clean your hands again after you take off the old dressing.
Caring for the Wound
You may use a gauze pad or soft cloth to clean the skin around your wound:

Use a normal saline solution (salt water) or mild soapy water.
Soak the gauze or cloth in the saline solutio...</div>
