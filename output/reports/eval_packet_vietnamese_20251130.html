            <div class='text-box original'>Heart Failure - Discharge

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is no longer able to pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body efficiently. When symptoms become severe, a hospital stay may be necessary. This article discusses what you need to do to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You were in the hospital to have your heart failure treated. Heart failure occurs when the muscles of your heart are weak or have trouble relaxing, or both.

Your heart is a pump that moves fluids through your body. As with any pump, if the flow out of the pump is not enough, fluids do not move well and they get stuck in places they should not be. In your body, this means that fluid collects in your lungs, abdomen, and legs.

While you were in the hospital:
Your health care team closely adjusted the fluids you drank or received through an intravenous (IV) line. They also watched and measured how much urine you produced.
You may have received medicines to help your body get rid of extra fluids.
You may have had tests to check how well your heart was working.

What to Expect at Home
Your energy will slowly return. You may need help taking care of yourself when you first get home. You may feel sad or depressed. All of these things are normal.

Checking Yourself at Home
Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale when you get up -- before you eat but after you use the bathroom. Make sure you are wearing similar clothing each time you weigh yourself. Write down your weight every day on a chart so that you can keep track of it.

Throughout the day, ask yourself:
Is my energy level normal?
Do I get more short of breath when I am doing my everyday activities?
Are my clothes or shoes feeling tight?
Are my ankles or legs swelling?
Am I coughing more often? Does my cough sound wet?
Do I get short of breath at night or when I lie down?

If you are having new (or different) symptoms, ask yourself:

Did I eat something different than usua...</div>

Suy tim là tình trạng tim không còn có thể bơm máu giàu oxy đi nuôi cơ thể một cách hiệu quả. Khi các triệu chứng trở nên nặng, có thể cần phải nằm viện. Tài liệu này nói về những việc bạn cần làm để tự chăm sóc bản thân khi rời bệnh viện.

Khi Bạn Ở Trong Bệnh Viện  
Bạn đã nằm viện để được điều trị suy tim. Suy tim xảy ra khi các cơ tim yếu đi hoặc khó thư giãn, hoặc cả hai.

Tim của bạn là một cái bơm đẩy chất lỏng đi khắp cơ thể. Giống như bất kỳ cái bơm nào, nếu lượng máu bơm ra không đủ, chất lỏng sẽ không lưu thông tốt và bị ứ lại ở những nơi không nên. Trong cơ thể bạn, điều này có nghĩa là dịch sẽ tích tụ trong phổi, bụng và chân.

Khi bạn ở trong bệnh viện:  
Đội ngũ chăm sóc sức khỏe đã điều chỉnh chặt chẽ lượng dịch bạn uống hoặc nhận qua đường truyền tĩnh mạch (IV). Họ cũng theo dõi và đo lượng nước tiểu bạn thải ra.  
Bạn có thể đã được dùng thuốc để giúp cơ thể loại bỏ bớt dịch thừa.  
Bạn có thể đã được làm các xét nghiệm để kiểm tra hoạt động của tim.

Những Điều Sẽ Gặp Khi Về Nhà  
Năng lượng của bạn sẽ dần dần hồi phục. Bạn có thể cần giúp đỡ trong việc tự chăm sóc bản thân khi mới về nhà. Bạn có thể cảm thấy buồn hoặc chán nản. Tất cả những điều này đều là bình thường.

Tự Kiểm Tra Tại Nhà  
Cân mỗi sáng trên cùng một cái cân ngay khi thức dậy – trước khi ăn nhưng sau khi đi vệ sinh. Hãy chắc chắn là bạn mặc quần áo tương tự nhau mỗi lần cân. Ghi lại cân nặng mỗi ngày vào một bảng để bạn có thể theo dõi.

Trong ngày, hãy tự hỏi:  
Mức năng lượng của tôi có bình thường không?  
Tôi có bị khó thở hơn khi làm các hoạt động hằng ngày không?  
Quần áo hoặc giày của tôi có cảm giác chật hơn không?  
Mắt cá chân hoặc chân tôi có bị sưng không?  
Tôi có ho thường xuyên hơn không? Tiếng ho có nghe ướt không?  
Tôi có bị khó thở vào ban đêm hoặc khi nằm xuống không?

Nếu bạn có các triệu chứng mới (hoặc khác thường), hãy tự hỏi:

Hôm nay tôi có ăn gì khác bình thường hoặc thử món ăn mới không?

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can no longer pump oxygen-rich blood to supply the body effectively. When symptoms become severe, hospitalization may be necessary. This document talks about what you need to do to take care of yourself when leaving the hospital.

When You Are in the Hospital  
You have been hospitalized to be treated for heart failure. Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle becomes weak or has difficulty relaxing, or both.

Your heart is a pump that pushes fluid throughout the body. Like any pump, if the amount of blood pumped out is not enough, fluid will not circulate well and will back up in places it should not. In your body, this means fluid will build up in the lungs, abdomen, and legs.

When you are in the hospital:  
The health care team has closely adjusted the amount of fluid you drink or receive through an intravenous (IV) line. They also monitored and measured the amount of urine you passed.  
You may have been given medicine to help your body get rid of excess fluid.  
You may have had tests done to check how your heart is working.

What to Expect at Home  
Your energy will gradually recover. You may need help with taking care of yourself when you first get home. You may feel sad or depressed. All of these things are normal.

Self-Monitoring at Home  
Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale as soon as you wake up – before eating but after using the bathroom. Make sure you wear similar clothing each time you weigh yourself. Record your weight every day on a chart so you can keep track.

During the day, ask yourself:  
Is my energy level normal?  
Am I more short of breath when doing daily activities?  
Do my clothes or shoes feel tighter?  
Are my ankles or legs swollen?  
Am I coughing more often? Does the cough sound wet?  
Do I have shortness of breath at night or when lying down?

Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told. Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines with it or at different times, and eating certain foods can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

What to Expect at Home
Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. This may be important if:

You have already had blood clots in your leg, arm, heart, or brain.
Your health care provider is worried that a blood clot may form in your body. People who have a new heart valve, a large heart, a heart rhythm that is not normal, or other heart problems may need to take warfarin.
When you are taking warfarin, you may be more likely to bleed, even from activities you have always done.

Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines, and eating certain foods all can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

Taking Warfarin
It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told.

Take only the dose your provider has prescribed. If you miss a dose, contact your provider for advice.
If your pills look different from your last prescription, contact your provider or pharmacist right away. The tablets are different colors, depending on the dose. The dose is also marked on the pill.
Your provider will test your blood at regular visits. This is called an INR test or sometimes a PT test. The test helps make sure you are taking the right amount of warfarin to help your body.

Alcohol and some medicines can change how warfarin works in your body.

DO NOT drink alcohol while you are taking warfarin.
Talk with your provider before taking any other over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, supplements, cold medicines, antibiotics, or other medicines.

            <div class='text-box translated'>Uống warfarin

Warfarin là một loại thuốc làm cho máu của bạn ít có khả năng hình thành cục máu đông hơn. Điều quan trọng là bạn phải uống warfarin đúng như đã được hướng dẫn. Thay đổi cách bạn uống warfarin, uống thêm thuốc khác cùng lúc hoặc vào thời điểm khác, và ăn một số loại thực phẩm nhất định có thể làm thay đổi cách warfarin hoạt động trong cơ thể bạn. Nếu điều này xảy ra, bạn có thể dễ bị hình thành cục máu đông hơn hoặc gặp vấn đề chảy máu.

Những điều cần biết khi về nhà
Warfarin là một loại thuốc làm cho máu của bạn ít có khả năng hình thành cục máu đông hơn. Điều này có thể quan trọng nếu:

Bạn đã từng bị cục máu đông ở chân, tay, tim hoặc não.
Nhà cung cấp dịch vụ chăm sóc sức khỏe (bác sĩ hoặc nhân viên y tế) lo ngại rằng có thể hình thành cục máu đông trong cơ thể bạn. Những người có van tim mới, tim to, rối loạn nhịp tim (nhịp tim không bình thường), hoặc các vấn đề tim khác có thể cần phải uống warfarin.
Khi bạn đang uống warfarin, bạn có thể dễ bị chảy máu hơn, ngay cả khi làm những việc bạn vẫn thường làm.

When your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the pressure of the blood against the artery walls is called your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is given as two numbers: systolic over diastolic blood pressure. Your systolic blood pressure is the highest blood pressure during the course of your heart beat cycle. Your diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure.

When your blood pressure gets too high, it puts extra stress on your heart and blood vessels. If your blood pressure stays high all the time, you will be at a higher risk for heart attacks and other vascular (blood vessel) diseases, strokes, kidney disease, and other health problems.

Below are questions you may want to ask your health care provider to help you take care of your blood pressure.

Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.

What is Low Blood Sugar?
Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.

You are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:

Insulin
Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)
You are also at increased risk of having low blood sugar if you have had previous low blood sugar levels.

Recognizing Low Blood Sugar
Know how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:

Weakness or feeling tired
Shaking
Sweating
Headache
Hunger
Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious
Feeling cranky
Trouble thinking clearly
Double or blurry vision
Fast or pounding heartbeat
Sometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:

Faint
Have a seizure
Go into a coma
Some people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.

Check Your Blood Sugar Often
Talk with your provider about when you should check your blood sugar every day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.

The most common causes of low blood sugar are:

Taking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time
Taking too much insul...</div>

            <div class='text-box translated'>Đường huyết thấp - tự chăm sóc

Đường huyết thấp là tình trạng xảy ra khi lượng đường (glucose) trong máu của bạn thấp hơn mức bình thường. Đường huyết thấp có thể xảy ra ở người bị đái tháo đường đang dùng insulin hoặc một số thuốc khác để kiểm soát bệnh đái tháo đường. Đường huyết thấp có thể gây ra các triệu chứng nguy hiểm. Hãy học cách nhận biết các triệu chứng của đường huyết thấp và cách phòng ngừa.

Đường huyết thấp là gì?
Đường huyết thấp được gọi là hạ đường huyết (hypoglycemia). Mức đường huyết dưới 70 mg/dL (3,9 mmol/L) là thấp và có thể gây hại cho bạn. Mức đường huyết dưới 54 mg/dL (3,0 mmol/L) là lý do cần phải hành động ngay lập tức.

Bạn có nguy cơ bị đường huyết thấp nếu bạn bị đái tháo đường và đang dùng bất kỳ loại thuốc điều trị đái tháo đường nào sau đây:

Insulin  
Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), hoặc nateglinide (Starlix)  
Bạn cũng có nguy cơ cao bị đường huyết thấp nếu trước đây bạn đã từng bị đường huyết thấp.

Nhận biết đường huyết thấp
Hãy biết cách nhận ra khi đường huyết của bạn đang giảm. Các triệu chứng bao gồm:

Yếu hoặc cảm thấy mệt  
Run rẩy  
Đổ mồ hôi  
Đau đầu  
Đói  
Cảm thấy bồn chồn, lo lắng hoặc bất an  
Dễ cáu gắt  
Khó suy nghĩ rõ ràng  
Nhìn đôi hoặc nhìn mờ  
Tim đập nhanh hoặc đập thình thịch  
Đôi khi đường huyết của bạn có thể quá thấp ngay cả khi bạn không có triệu chứng. Nếu đường huyết xuống quá thấp, bạn có thể:

Ngất xỉu  
Bị co giật  
Hôn mê  
Một số người bị đái tháo đường lâu năm không còn cảm nhận được khi đường huyết thấp. Điều này được gọi là mất nhận biết hạ đường huyết (hypoglycemic unawareness). Hãy hỏi nhân viên y tế của bạn xem việc đeo máy theo dõi đường huyết liên tục (continuous glucose monitor) và cảm biến có thể giúp bạn phát hiện khi đường huyết đang xuống quá thấp để giúp phòng ngừa triệu chứng hay không.

Kiểm tra đường huyết thường xuyên
Trao đổi với nhân viên y tế của bạn về thời điểm bạn nên kiểm tra đường huyết mỗi ngày. Những ngườ...</div>

            <div class='text-box translated'>Lượng đường trong máu thấp - tự chăm sóc

Lượng đường trong máu thấp là tình trạng xảy ra khi lượng đường trong máu (glucose) của bạn thấp hơn bình thường. Lượng đường trong máu thấp có thể xảy ra ở những người mắc bệnh tiểu đường đang sử dụng insulin hoặc một số loại thuốc khác để kiểm soát bệnh tiểu đường. Lượng đường trong máu thấp có thể gây ra các triệu chứng nguy hiểm. Hãy tìm hiểu cách nhận biết các triệu chứng của lượng đường trong máu thấp và cách phòng ngừa chúng.

Lượng Đường Trong Máu Thấp Là Gì?
Lượng đường trong máu thấp được gọi là hạ đường huyết. Mức đường trong máu dưới 70 mg/dL (3,9 mmol/L) là thấp và có thể gây hại cho bạn. Mức đường trong máu dưới 54 mg/dL (3,0 mmol/L) là nguyên nhân cần hành động ngay lập tức.

Bạn có nguy cơ bị hạ đường huyết nếu bạn mắc bệnh tiểu đường và đang dùng bất kỳ loại thuốc tiểu đường nào sau đây:

Insulin
Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), hoặc nateglinide (Starlix)
Bạn cũng có nguy cơ cao bị hạ đường huyết nếu bạn đã từng bị hạ đường huyết trước đây.

Nhận Biết Lượng Đường Trong Máu Thấp
Hãy biết cách nhận ra khi lượng đường trong máu của bạn đang giảm. Các triệu chứng bao gồm:

Yếu sức hoặc cảm thấy mệt mỏi
Run rẩy
Đổ mồ hôi
Đau đầu
Đói
Cảm thấy bồn chồn, lo lắng, hoặc hồi hộp
Cảm thấy cáu kỉnh
Khó suy nghĩ rõ ràng
Nhìn đôi hoặc nhìn mờ
Tim đập nhanh hoặc đập mạnh
Đôi khi lượng đường trong máu của bạn có thể quá thấp ngay cả khi bạn không có triệu chứng. Nếu nó xuống quá thấp, bạn có thể:

Ngất xỉu
Co giật
Hôn mê
Một số người mắc bệnh tiểu đường lâu năm không còn khả năng cảm nhận được lượng đường trong máu thấp. Điều này được gọi là mất nhận biết hạ đường huyết. Hãy hỏi nhà cung cấp dịch vụ chăm sóc sức khỏe của bạn xem việc đeo máy theo dõi đường huyết liên tục và cảm biến có thể giúp bạn phát hiện khi lượng đường trong máu đang xuống quá thấp để giúp ngăn ngừa các triệu chứng hay không.

Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar can occur in people with diabetes who are using insulin or some other medications to control diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.

What Is Low Blood Sugar?
Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can be harmful to you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.

You are at risk for hypoglycemia if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medications:

Insulin
Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)
You are also at high risk for hypoglycemia if you have had hypoglycemia before.

Recognizing Low Blood Sugar
Know how to recognize when your blood sugar is dropping. Symptoms include:

Weakness or feeling tired
Shaking
Sweating
Headache
Hunger
Feeling restless, anxious, or nervous
Feeling irritable
Difficulty thinking clearly
Double vision or blurred vision
Fast heartbeat or pounding heartbeat
Sometimes your blood sugar can be too low even when you don't have symptoms. If it goes too low, you may:

Faint
Have a seizure
Go into a coma
Some people with long-standing diabetes no longer have the ability to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemia unawareness. Ask your health care provider whether wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when blood sugar is getting too low to help prevent symptoms.

Checking Blood Sugar Regularly
Talk with your doctor about when you should check your blood sugar each day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.

The most common causes of hypoglycemia are:

Taking insulin or diabetes medication at the wrong time
Taking too much insulin or diabet...</div>

            <div class='text-box back-translated'>Asthma - quick-relief medications

Asthma quick-relief medications have a quick effect to control asthma symptoms. You use the medicine when coughing, wheezing, having shortness of breath, or having an asthma attack. These medicines are also called rescue medications.

Many of these medicines are called "bronchodilators" because they open up (dilate) and help relax the muscles of the airways (bronchi).

You and your health care provider can make a plan to use quick-relief medications suitable for you. This plan will include when you should use the medicine and the dosage needed.

Plan ahead. Make sure you do not run out of medicine. Bring enough medicine when traveling.

Short-acting Beta agonists
Short-acting beta agonists are the most common type of quick-relief medicine to treat asthma attacks and are considered bronchodilators.

The medicine can be used right before exercising to help prevent exercise-induced asthma symptoms. The medicine works by relaxing the airway muscles, helping you breathe easier during an asthma attack.

Let the health care provider know if you use quick-relief medicine two or more times a week to control asthma symptoms. Your asthma may not be well controlled, and the health care provider may need to change your daily controller medicine dosage.

Some asthma quick-relief medications include:

*   Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
*   Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
*   Metaproterenol
*   Terbutaline

Short-acting beta agonists can cause the following side effects:

*   Anxiety.
*   Fast and irregular heartbeat. Call the health care provider immediately if you experience this side effect.
*   Headache.
*   Restlessness.
*   Tremors (hands or another part of the body may shake).

Oral steroids
The health care provider may prescribe oral steroids when you have an asthma attack that does not improve. These are medicines you take by mouth in the form of tablets, capsules, or liquid medicine.

Oral steroids are not quick-relief me...</div>

You were in the hospital after having a stroke. A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain stops.

At home follow your health care provider's instructions on self-care. Use the information below as a reminder.

When You're in the Hospital
First, you received treatment to prevent further damage to the brain, and to help the heart, lungs, and other important organs heal.

After you were stable, your providers did testing and started treatment to help you recover from the stroke and prevent a future stroke. You may have stayed in a special unit that helps people recover after a stroke.

Changes in behavior
Doing easy tasks
Memory
Moving one side of the body
Muscle spasms
Paying attention
Sensation or awareness of one part of the body
Swallowing
Talking or understanding others
Thinking
Seeing to one side (hemianopsia)
You may need help with daily activities you used to do alone before the stroke. You may have physical or occupational therapy to restore your ability to perform these functions.

Depression after a stroke is fairly common as you learn to live with the changes. It may develop soon after the stroke or up to 2 years after the stroke.

Do not drive your car without your provider's permission.

Moving Around
Moving around and doing normal tasks may be hard after a stroke.

Make sure your home is safe. Ask your provider, therapist, or nurse about making changes in your home to make it easier to do everyday activities.

Quý vị đã nằm viện sau khi bị đột quỵ. Đột quỵ xảy ra khi dòng máu chảy đến một phần của não bị ngưng lại.

Tại nhà, hãy làm theo hướng dẫn của nhà cung cấp dịch vụ chăm sóc sức khỏe về việc tự chăm sóc. Sử dụng thông tin dưới đây như một lời nhắc nhở.

Khi Quý Vị Ở Trong Bệnh Viện
Đầu tiên, quý vị đã được điều trị để ngăn ngừa tổn thương thêm cho não, và giúp tim, phổi, và các cơ quan quan trọng khác hồi phục.

Sau khi tình trạng ổn định, các nhà cung cấp dịch vụ y tế đã làm xét nghiệm và bắt đầu điều trị để giúp quý vị phục hồi sau đột quỵ và ngăn ngừa đột quỵ trong tương lai. Quý vị có thể đã ở tại một đơn vị đặc biệt giúp mọi người phục hồi sau đột quỵ.

Những Điều Cần Biết Khi Ở Nhà
Do não có thể bị tổn thương từ cơn đột quỵ, quý vị có thể nhận thấy các vấn đề về:

*   Thay đổi hành vi

Quý vị có thể cần giúp đỡ với các hoạt động hàng ngày mà trước đây quý vị tự làm một mình. Quý vị có thể cần vật lý trị liệu hoặc hoạt động trị liệu để khôi phục khả năng thực hiện các chức năng này.

Trầm cảm sau đột quỵ khá phổ biến khi quý vị học cách sống chung với những thay đổi. Tình trạng này có thể phát triển ngay sau cơn đột quỵ hoặc lên đến 2 năm sau đó.

Không được lái xe nếu không có sự cho phép của nhà cung cấp dịch vụ y tế.

Di Chuyển
Di chuyển và làm các công việc bình thường có thể khó khăn sau đột quỵ.

Đảm bảo nhà của quý vị được an toàn. Hỏi nhà cung cấp dịch vụ y tế, chuyên gia trị liệu hoặc y tá về việc thay đổi trong nhà để giúp các hoạt động hàng ngày dễ dàng hơn.

Tìm hiểu xem quý vị có thể làm gì để ngăn ngừa té ngã và giữ cho phòng tắm an toàn khi sử dụng.

            <div class='text-box back-translated'>Stroke - discharge

You were in the hospital after having a stroke. A stroke happens when blood flow to a part of the brain is stopped.

At home, follow the health care provider's instructions on self-care. Use the information below as a reminder.

When You Were In The Hospital
First, you were treated to prevent further damage to the brain, and help the heart, lungs, and other vital organs recover.

After the condition stabilized, health care providers did tests and started treatment to help you recover from the stroke and prevent future strokes. You may have stayed in a special unit that helps people recover after a stroke.

Things To Know When At Home
Because the brain may be damaged from the stroke, you may notice problems with:

*   Behavior changes
*   Doing simple tasks
*   Memory
*   Moving one side of the body
*   Muscle spasms
*   Attention
*   Sensation or awareness of a body part
*   Swallowing
*   Speaking or understanding others
*   Thinking
*   Seeing to one side (hemianopia)

You may need help with daily activities that you used to do alone before. You may need physical therapy or occupational therapy to restore the ability to perform these functions.

Depression after stroke is quite common as you learn to live with the changes. This condition can develop right after the stroke or up to 2 years later.

Do not drive without the permission of the health care provider.

Moving Around
Moving and doing normal tasks can be difficult after a stroke.

Make sure your home is safe. Ask the health care provider, therapist, or nurse about changes in the home to help make daily activities easier.

Find out what you can do to prevent falls and keep the bathroom safe when using it.

Family and caregivers may need help:

*   Exercises to keep elbows, shoulders, and other joints flexible
*   Monitoring joint stiffness (contractures)
*   Ensuring splints are used properly
*   Ensuring arms and legs are in good position when sitting or lying down

An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the kind of surgery you had.

Sometimes, an incision breaks open. This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).

What to Expect at Home
If your surgeon does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. A dressing helps absorb drainage and keep the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.

Proper Handwashing
It is important to clean your hands before you change your dressing. You can use an alcohol-based cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands using these steps:

Take all jewelry off your hands.
Wet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.
Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or the "Alphabet Song" one time through). Clean under your nails also.
Rinse well.
Dry with a clean towel.
Removing the Old Dressing
Your health care provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. To prepare for the dressing change:

Clean your hands before touching the dressing.
Make sure you have all the supplies handy.
Have a clean work surface.
Remove the old dressing:

Carefully loosen the tape from your skin.
Use a clean (not sterile) medical glove to grab the old dressing and pull it off.
If the dressing sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your provider instructed you to pull it off dry.
Put the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.
Clean your hands again after you take off the old dressing.
Caring for the Wound
You may use a gauze pad or soft cloth to clean the skin around your wound:

Use a normal saline solution (salt water) or mild soapy water.
Soak the gauze or cloth in the saline solutio...</div>

Đường rạch là một vết cắt qua da được tạo ra trong khi phẫu thuật. Nó cũng được gọi là vết mổ phẫu thuật. Một số đường rạch nhỏ, một số khác thì dài. Kích thước của đường rạch phụ thuộc vào loại phẫu thuật mà bạn đã thực hiện.

Đôi khi, vết mổ bị hở ra. Điều này có thể xảy ra dọc theo toàn bộ vết cắt hoặc chỉ một phần. Bác sĩ phẫu thuật của bạn có thể quyết định không khâu (sutures, stitches) lại lần nữa.

Những điều sẽ xảy ra tại nhà
Nếu bác sĩ phẫu thuật không khâu lại vết thương của bạn bằng sutures, bạn cần tự chăm sóc tại nhà, vì có thể mất thời gian để lành. Vết thương sẽ lành từ dưới lên trên. Băng (dressing) giúp thấm dịch chảy ra và ngăn da bên ngoài đóng lại trước khi phần vết thương bên dưới được lấp đầy.

Rửa tay đúng cách
Điều quan trọng là phải làm sạch tay trước khi bạn thay băng. Bạn có thể dùng dung dịch rửa tay có cồn. Hoặc, bạn có thể rửa tay theo các bước sau:

Tháo tất cả đồ trang sức trên tay.
Làm ướt tay, hướng các ngón tay xuống dưới vòi nước ấm đang chảy.
Thêm xà phòng và rửa tay trong 15 đến 30 giây (hát một lần bài "Chúc mừng sinh nhật" hoặc bài "Bảng chữ cái"). Làm sạch cả dưới móng tay.
Rửa lại thật kỹ.
Lau khô bằng khăn sạch.
Tháo băng cũ
Nhân viên y tế sẽ cho bạn biết cần thay băng bao lâu một lần. Để chuẩn bị thay băng:

Rửa sạch tay trước khi chạm vào băng.
Đảm bảo bạn có sẵn tất cả vật dụng cần thiết.
Chuẩn bị một bề mặt làm việc sạch.
Tháo băng cũ:

Tháo băng dính khỏi da một cách nhẹ nhàng.
Dùng găng tay y tế sạch (không cần vô trùng) để cầm băng cũ và kéo ra.
Nếu băng dính vào vết thương, làm ướt băng rồi thử lại, trừ khi nhân viên y tế đã dặn bạn phải kéo băng khô ra.
Bỏ băng cũ vào túi nhựa và để sang một bên.
Rửa tay lại sau khi tháo băng cũ.
Chăm sóc vết thương
Bạn có thể dùng miếng gạc (gauze pad) hoặc khăn mềm để làm sạch da xung quanh vết thương:

Dùng dung dịch nước muối sinh lý (normal saline solution) hoặc nước xà phòng loãng.

An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the type of surgery that you had.

Sometimes, the wound opens up. This can happen along the entire cut or only a part. Your surgeon may decide not to sew (sutures, stitches) it closed again.

What will happen at home  
If the surgeon does not sew your wound closed again with sutures, you need to take care of it at home yourself, because it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom up. The dressing helps absorb the drainage and prevents the outer skin from closing before the lower part of the wound is filled in.

Proper handwashing  
It is important to clean your hands before you change the dressing. You can use an alcohol-based hand cleaner. Or, you can wash your hands using the following steps:

Remove all jewelry on your hands.  
Wet your hands, pointing your fingers down under warm running water.  
Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing the “Happy Birthday” song or the “Alphabet” song once). Clean under your fingernails as well.  
Rinse thoroughly.  
Dry with a clean towel.

Removing the old dressing  
Your health care provider will tell you how often you need to change the dressing. To prepare to change the dressing:

Wash your hands before touching the dressing.  
Make sure you have all the supplies you need ready.  
Prepare a clean work surface.

Remove the old dressing:

Gently remove the tape from your skin.  
Use clean medical gloves (do not need to be sterile) to hold the old dressing and pull it off.  
If the dressing sticks to the wound, wet the dressing and then try again, unless your health care provider has told you that you must pull the dressing off dry.

You had surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint called a prosthesis. This article tells you what you need to do to care for your new hip when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You had a hip joint replacement surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.

What to Expect at Home
By the time you go home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without needing much help. Most people do not need them after 2 to 4 weeks. Check with your surgeon about when to stop using crutches.

You should also be able to dress yourself with only a little help and be able to get into and out of your bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help.

You will need to be careful that you do not dislocate your artificial hip, especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions.

You will need to have someone with you at home for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehab center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.

Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.

Home Setup
Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You may not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.

Keep tripping hazards out of your home.

Bạn đã được phẫu thuật thay toàn bộ hoặc một phần khớp háng bằng một khớp nhân tạo gọi là prosthesis. Tài liệu này hướng dẫn bạn cách chăm sóc khớp háng mới sau khi rời bệnh viện.

Khi Bạn Còn Ở Bệnh Viện  
Bạn đã được phẫu thuật thay khớp háng để thay toàn bộ hoặc một phần khớp háng bằng một khớp nhân tạo. Khớp nhân tạo này được gọi là prosthesis.

Những Điều Sẽ Gặp Khi Về Nhà  
Khi về nhà, bạn nên có thể đi lại với khung tập đi (walker) hoặc nạng mà không cần nhiều trợ giúp. Hầu hết mọi người không cần dùng nữa sau 2 đến 4 tuần. Hãy hỏi bác sĩ phẫu thuật về thời điểm ngừng dùng nạng.

Bạn cũng nên có thể tự mặc quần áo với rất ít trợ giúp và có thể tự lên xuống giường hoặc ghế. Bạn cũng nên có thể tự đi vệ sinh mà không cần nhiều giúp đỡ.

Bạn sẽ cần cẩn thận để không làm trật khớp háng nhân tạo, đặc biệt trong vài tháng đầu sau phẫu thuật. Bạn sẽ cần học các bài tập giúp khớp háng mới khỏe hơn và thực hiện các biện pháp phòng ngừa đặc biệt.

You have had surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint called a prosthesis. This document guides you on how to care for your new hip after leaving the hospital.

When You Are Still in the Hospital  
You have had hip replacement surgery to replace all or part of the hip joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.

What to Expect When You Get Home  
When you get home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without much help. Most people no longer need to use them after 2 to 4 weeks. Ask your surgeon when to stop using crutches.

You should also be able to dress yourself with very little help and be able to get in and out of bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to go to the bathroom by yourself without much help.

You will need to be careful not to dislocate the artificial hip, especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises to help make the new hip stronger and follow special precautions.

You will need to have someone at home with you for 1 to 2 weeks after leaving the hospital or rehabilitation center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.

Over time, you may return to your previous level of activity. You will need to avoid certain sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you can still take part in low-impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and playing golf.

Arranging Your Home  
Your bed should be low enough so that your feet touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. The bed should also be high enough so that when you sit on the edge, your hips are higher than your knees. You may not need a hospital bed, but the mattress should be firm, not too soft.

Keep your home free of items that can easily cause tripping.

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is no longer able to pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body efficiently. When symptoms become severe, a hospital stay may be necessary. This article discusses what you need to do to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You were in the hospital to have your heart failure treated. Heart failure occurs when the muscles of your heart are weak or have trouble relaxing, or both.

Your heart is a pump that moves fluids through your body. As with any pump, if the flow out of the pump is not enough, fluids do not move well and they get stuck in places they should not be. In your body, this means that fluid collects in your lungs, abdomen, and legs.

While you were in the hospital:
Your health care team closely adjusted the fluids you drank or received through an intravenous (IV) line. They also watched and measured how much urine you produced.
You may have received medicines to help your body get rid of extra fluids.
You may have had tests to check how well your heart was working.

What to Expect at Home
Your energy will slowly return. You may need help taking care of yourself when you first get home. You may feel sad or depressed. All of these things are normal.

Checking Yourself at Home
Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale when you get up -- before you eat but after you use the bathroom. Make sure you are wearing similar clothing each time you weigh yourself. Write down your weight every day on a chart so that you can keep track of it.

Throughout the day, ask yourself:
Is my energy level normal?
Do I get more short of breath when I am doing my everyday activities?
Are my clothes or shoes feeling tight?
Are my ankles or legs swelling?
Am I coughing more often? Does my cough sound wet?
Do I get short of breath at night or when I lie down?

Suy tim là tình trạng tim không còn khả năng bơm máu giàu oxy đến phần còn lại của cơ thể một cách hiệu quả. Khi các triệu chứng trở nên nghiêm trọng, quý vị có thể cần phải nằm viện. Bài viết này thảo luận về những gì quý vị cần làm để tự chăm sóc bản thân khi rời khỏi bệnh viện.

Khi Quý Vị Ở Bệnh Viện

Quý vị đã nằm viện để điều trị suy tim. Suy tim xảy ra khi cơ tim của quý vị bị yếu hoặc gặp khó khăn trong việc thư giãn, hoặc cả hai.

Tim của quý vị là một cái bơm di chuyển dịch trong cơ thể. Giống như bất kỳ cái bơm nào, nếu dòng chảy ra khỏi bơm không đủ, dịch sẽ không di chuyển tốt và bị mắc kẹt ở những nơi không nên có. Trong cơ thể quý vị, điều này có nghĩa là dịch tích tụ trong phổi, bụng và chân.

Trong khi quý vị ở bệnh viện:
Nhóm chăm sóc sức khỏe của quý vị đã điều chỉnh chặt chẽ lượng dịch quý vị uống hoặc nhận qua đường truyền tĩnh mạch (IV). Họ cũng theo dõi và đo lượng nước tiểu quý vị sản xuất.
Quý vị có thể đã được dùng thuốc để giúp cơ thể loại bỏ dịch dư thừa.
Quý vị có thể đã làm các xét nghiệm để kiểm tra mức độ tim hoạt động.

Những Gì Có Thể Mong Đợi Ở Nhà

Năng lượng của quý vị sẽ dần dần hồi phục. Quý vị có thể cần giúp đỡ trong việc tự chăm sóc bản thân khi mới về nhà. Quý vị có thể cảm thấy buồn hoặc chán nản. Tất cả những điều này đều bình thường.

Tự Kiểm Tra Ở Nhà

Cân mình mỗi buổi sáng trên cùng một cái cân khi quý vị thức dậy - trước khi ăn nhưng sau khi đi vệ sinh. Hãy đảm bảo quý vị mặc quần áo tương tự mỗi lần cân. Ghi lại cân nặng của quý vị mỗi ngày trên một biểu đồ để quý vị có thể theo dõi.

Suốt cả ngày, hãy tự hỏi mình:
Mức năng lượng của tôi có bình thường không?
Tôi có bị khó thở nhiều hơn khi làm các hoạt động hàng ngày không?
Quần áo hoặc giày của tôi có cảm thấy chật không?
Mắt cá chân hoặc chân của tôi có bị sưng không?
Tôi có ho thường xuyên hơn không? Tiếng ho của tôi có nghe ướt không?
Tôi có bị khó thở vào ban đêm hoặc khi nằm xuống không?

Heart failure is a condition where the heart no longer has the ability to pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body effectively. When symptoms become serious, you may need to be hospitalized. This article discusses what you need to do to take care of yourself when leaving the hospital.

When You Are In The Hospital

You have been hospitalized to treat heart failure. Heart failure occurs when your heart muscle is weak or has difficulty relaxing, or both.

Your heart is a pump that moves fluid in the body. Like any pump, if the flow out of the pump is insufficient, fluid will not move well and gets stuck in places where it shouldn't be. In your body, this means fluid accumulates in the lungs, abdomen and legs.

While you are in the hospital:
Your health care team has tightly adjusted the amount of fluid you drink or receive through intravenous (IV) line. They also monitored and measured the amount of urine you produced.
You may have been given medication to help the body eliminate excess fluid.
You may have done tests to check the level of heart activity.

What To Expect At Home

Your energy will gradually recover. You may need help in taking care of yourself when newly home. You may feel sad or depressed. All of these are normal.

Self-Check At Home

Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale when you wake up - before eating but after using the bathroom. Make sure you wear similar clothes each time you weigh. Record your weight every day on a chart so you can track.

Throughout the day, ask yourself:
Is my energy level normal?
Do I have more difficulty breathing when doing daily activities?
Do my clothes or shoes feel tight?
Are my ankles or legs swollen?
Am I coughing more frequently? Does my cough sound wet?
Do I have difficulty breathing at night or when lying down?

If you have new (or unusual) symptoms, ask yourself:
Did I eat anything out of the ordinary or try a new food?
Did I take all medication correctly and on time?

When your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the pressure of the blood against the artery walls is called your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is given as two numbers: systolic over diastolic blood pressure. Your systolic blood pressure is the highest blood pressure during the course of your heart beat cycle. Your diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure.

When your blood pressure gets too high, it puts extra stress on your heart and blood vessels. If your blood pressure stays high all the time, you will be at a higher risk for heart attacks and other vascular (blood vessel) diseases, strokes, kidney disease, and other health problems.

Below are questions you may want to ask your health care provider to help you take care of your blood pressure.

Questions
How can I change the way I live to lower my blood pressure?

What is a heart-healthy diet? Is it OK to ever eat something that is not heart healthy? What are some ways to eat healthy when I go to a restaurant?
Do I need to limit how much salt I use? Are there other spices that I can use to make my food taste good?

Huyết áp cao - những điều cần hỏi bác sĩ

Khi tim bạn bơm máu vào động mạch, áp lực của máu tác động lên thành động mạch được gọi là huyết áp của bạn. Huyết áp của bạn được ghi dưới dạng hai con số: huyết áp tâm thu trên huyết áp tâm trương. Huyết áp tâm thu của bạn là áp lực máu cao nhất trong chu kỳ đập của tim. Huyết áp tâm trương của bạn là áp lực thấp nhất.

Khi huyết áp của bạn quá cao, nó gây thêm áp lực lên tim và mạch máu của bạn. Nếu huyết áp của bạn luôn ở mức cao, bạn sẽ có nguy cơ cao hơn mắc các cơn đau tim và các bệnh mạch máu khác, đột quỵ, bệnh thận, và các vấn đề sức khỏe khác.

Dưới đây là những câu hỏi bạn có thể muốn hỏi bác sĩ của mình để giúp bạn chăm sóc huyết áp.

Những câu hỏi
Tôi có thể thay đổi lối sống như thế nào để hạ huyết áp?

Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.

What is Low Blood Sugar?
Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.

You are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:

Insulin
Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)
You are also at increased risk of having low blood sugar if you have had previous low blood sugar levels.

Recognizing Low Blood Sugar
Know how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:

Weakness or feeling tired
Shaking
Sweating
Headache
Hunger
Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious
Feeling cranky
Trouble thinking clearly
Double or blurry vision
Fast or pounding heartbeat
Sometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:

Faint
Have a seizure
Go into a coma
Some people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.

Check Your Blood Sugar Often
Talk with your provider about when you should check your blood sugar every day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.

The most common causes of low blood sugar are:

Taking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time
Taking too much insul...</div>

Đường huyết thấp là tình trạng xảy ra khi đường huyết (glucose) của bạn thấp hơn mức bình thường. Đường huyết thấp có thể xảy ra ở người bị bệnh tiểu đường đang dùng insulin hoặc một số thuốc khác để kiểm soát bệnh tiểu đường. Đường huyết thấp có thể gây ra các triệu chứng nguy hiểm. Hãy học cách nhận biết các triệu chứng của đường huyết thấp và cách phòng ngừa chúng.

Đường huyết thấp là gì?

Đường huyết thấp được gọi là hạ đường huyết. Mức đường huyết dưới 70 mg/dL (3,9 mmol/L) là thấp và có thể gây hại cho bạn. Mức đường huyết dưới 54 mg/dL (3,0 mmol/L) là lý do để hành động ngay lập tức.

Bạn có nguy cơ bị đường huyết thấp nếu bị bệnh tiểu đường và đang dùng bất kỳ loại thuốc tiểu đường nào sau đây:

* Insulin
* Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), hoặc nateglinide (Starlix)

Bạn cũng có nguy cơ cao bị đường huyết thấp nếu bạn đã từng có mức đường huyết thấp trước đó.

Nhận biết đường huyết thấp

Hãy biết cách nhận biết khi đường huyết của bạn đang giảm. Các triệu chứng bao gồm:

* Yếu hoặc cảm thấy mệt mỏi
* Rung lắc
* Đổ mồ hôi
* Đau đầu
* Đói
* Cảm thấy bồn chồn, lo lắng, hoặc căng thẳng
* Cảm thấy cáu kỉnh
* Khó suy nghĩ rõ ràng
* Nhìn đôi hoặc mờ
* Tim đập nhanh hoặc đập mạnh

Đôi khi đường huyết của bạn có thể quá thấp ngay cả khi bạn không có triệu chứng. Nếu đường huyết giảm quá thấp, bạn có thể:

* Ngất xỉu
* Bị co giật
* Rơi vào hôn mê

Một số người bị bệnh tiểu đường trong thời gian dài không còn khả năng cảm nhận đường huyết thấp. Điều này được gọi là mất cảnh báo hạ đường huyết. Hỏi bác sĩ của bạn liệu đeo máy theo dõi đường huyết liên tục và cảm biến có thể giúp bạn phát hiện khi đường huyết của bạn đang giảm quá thấp để giúp phòng ngừa các triệu chứng hay không.

Kiểm tra đường huyết thường xuyên

Nói chuyện với bác sĩ của bạn về thời điểm bạn nên kiểm tra đường huyết mỗi ngày. Những người bị đường huyết thấp cần kiểm tra đường huyết thường xuyên hơn.

Asthma quick-relief medicines work fast to control asthma symptoms. You take them when you are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack. They are also called rescue medicines.

Many of these medicines are called "bronchodilators" because they open (dilate) and help relax the muscles of your airways (bronchi).

You and your health care provider can make a plan for the quick-relief medicines that work for you. This plan will include when you should take them and how much you should take.

Plan ahead. Make sure you do not run out. Bring enough medicine with you when you travel.

Short-acting Beta-agonists
Short-acting beta-agonists are the most common quick-relief medicines for treating asthma attacks and are considered to be bronchodilators.

Some quick-relief asthma medicines include:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline

An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the kind of surgery you had.

Sometimes, an incision breaks open. This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).

What to Expect at Home
If your surgeon does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. A dressing helps absorb drainage and keep the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.

Proper Handwashing
It is important to clean your hands before you change your dressing. You can use an alcohol-based cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands using these steps:

Take all jewelry off your hands.
Wet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.
Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or the "Alphabet Song" one time through). Clean under your nails also.
Rinse well.
Dry with a clean towel.
Removing the Old Dressing
Your health care provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. To prepare for the dressing change:

Clean your hands before touching the dressing.
Make sure you have all the supplies handy.
Have a clean work surface.
Remove the old dressing:

Carefully loosen the tape from your skin.
Use a clean (not sterile) medical glove to grab the old dressing and pull it off.
If the dressing sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your provider instructed you to pull it off dry.
Put the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.
Clean your hands again after you take off the old dressing.
Caring for the Wound
You may use a gauze pad or soft cloth to clean the skin around your wound:

Những gì cần biết khi ở nhà

Nếu bác sĩ phẫu thuật không khâu đóng vết thương của bạn lại, bạn cần phải chăm sóc nó tại nhà, vì nó có thể mất thời gian để lành. Vết thương sẽ lành từ dưới lên trên. Băng gạc giúp thấm dịch tiết và ngăn da đóng lại trước khi vết thương bên dưới lành đầy.

Rửa tay đúng cách

Rất quan trọng phải làm sạch tay trước khi bạn thay băng gạc. Bạn có thể dùng chất làm sạch tay có cồn. Hoặc, bạn có thể rửa tay theo các bước sau:

1. Tháo tất cả trang sức trên tay.
2. Làm ướt tay, hướng tay xuống dưới vòi nước ấm đang chảy.
3. Cho xà phòng và rửa tay trong 15 đến 30 giây (hát "Happy Birthday" hoặc "Bài hát Bảng chữ cái" một lần). Làm sạch dưới móng tay nữa.
4. Xả sạch.
5. Lau khô bằng khăn sạch.

Tháo băng gạc cũ

Nhân viên chăm sóc sức khỏe của bạn sẽ cho biết bạn cần thay băng gạc bao lâu một lần. Để chuẩn bị thay băng gạc:

- Làm sạch tay trước khi chạm vào băng gạc.

The surgical incision is a cut through the skin performed in surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, some others are long. The size of the incision depends on the type of surgery you have undergone.

Sometimes, the incision opens up. This can happen along the entire cut or only a part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it with sutures (stitches).

What you need to know when at home

If your surgeon does not suture your wound closed, you need to care for it at home, because it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from bottom to top. Gauze helps absorb drainage and prevents the skin from closing before the wound underneath heals completely.

Proper hand washing

It is very important to clean your hands before you change the gauze. You can use alcohol-based hand cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands following these steps:

1. Remove all jewelry on your hands.
2. Wet your hands, directing hands downward under warm running water.
3. Apply soap and wash hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or "The Alphabet Song" once). Clean under fingernails too.
4. Rinse thoroughly.
5. Dry with a clean towel.

Removing the old gauze

Your healthcare worker will tell you how often you need to change the gauze. To prepare to change the gauze:

- Clean hands before touching the gauze.
- Ensure you have all necessary supplies ready.
- Have a clean work surface.

Removing the old gauze:

1. Gently peel the adhesive tape off the skin.
2. Use clean (non-sterile) medical gloves to hold the old gauze and pull it out.
3. If the gauze sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your healthcare worker instructs you to remove it when dry.
4. Put the old gauze in a plastic bag and set aside.
5. Clean your hands again after you remove the old gauze.

Caring for the wound

You can use a piece of gauze or soft cloth to clean the skin around the wound:

- Use normal saline solution (salt water) or diluted soapy w...</div>
