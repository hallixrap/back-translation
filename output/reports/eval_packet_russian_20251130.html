            <div class='text-box original'>Heart Failure - Discharge

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is no longer able to pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body efficiently. When symptoms become severe, a hospital stay may be necessary. This article discusses what you need to do to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You were in the hospital to have your heart failure treated. Heart failure occurs when the muscles of your heart are weak or have trouble relaxing, or both.

Your heart is a pump that moves fluids through your body. As with any pump, if the flow out of the pump is not enough, fluids do not move well and they get stuck in places they should not be. In your body, this means that fluid collects in your lungs, abdomen, and legs.

While you were in the hospital:
Your health care team closely adjusted the fluids you drank or received through an intravenous (IV) line. They also watched and measured how much urine you produced.
You may have received medicines to help your body get rid of extra fluids.
You may have had tests to check how well your heart was working.

What to Expect at Home
Your energy will slowly return. You may need help taking care of yourself when you first get home. You may feel sad or depressed. All of these things are normal.

Checking Yourself at Home
Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale when you get up -- before you eat but after you use the bathroom. Make sure you are wearing similar clothing each time you weigh yourself. Write down your weight every day on a chart so that you can keep track of it.

Throughout the day, ask yourself:
Is my energy level normal?
Do I get more short of breath when I am doing my everyday activities?
Are my clothes or shoes feeling tight?
Are my ankles or legs swelling?
Am I coughing more often? Does my cough sound wet?
Do I get short of breath at night or when I lie down?

If you are having new (or different) symptoms, ask yourself:

Did I eat something different than usua...</div>

            <div class='text-box translated'>Сердечная недостаточность – Выписка

Сердечная недостаточность – это состояние, при котором сердце больше не может эффективно перекачивать богатую кислородом кровь к остальным частям тела. Когда симптомы становятся тяжелыми, может понадобиться пребывание в больнице. В этой статье рассказывается, что вам нужно делать, чтобы заботиться о себе после выписки из больницы.

Когда вы в больнице  
Вы находились в больнице для лечения сердечной недостаточности. Сердечная недостаточность возникает, когда мышцы сердца ослаблены или плохо расслабляются, или и то и другое вместе.

Ваше сердце – это насос, который перемещает жидкости по вашему организму. Как и любой насос, если выходящий из него поток недостаточен, жидкости плохо движутся и застаиваются там, где не должны. В вашем организме это означает, что жидкость скапливается в легких, брюшной полости и ногах.

Пока вы были в больнице:
Ваша медицинская бригада тщательно регулировала количество жидкости, которую вы пили или получали через внутривенную (IV) линию. Они также наблюдали и измеряли, сколько мочи вы выделяете.
Вам могли назначить лекарства, помогающие организму избавиться от лишней жидкости.
Вам могли провести обследования, чтобы проверить, насколько хорошо работает ваше сердце.

Чего ожидать дома  
Ваша энергия будет постепенно возвращаться. Вначале, когда вы вернетесь домой, вам может понадобиться помощь в уходе за собой. Вы можете чувствовать себя грустным или подавленным. Все это нормально.

Самоконтроль дома  
Взвешивайтесь каждое утро на одних и тех же весах сразу после пробуждения – до еды, но после посещения туалета. Убедитесь, что вы каждый раз взвешиваетесь в похожей одежде. Записывайте свой вес каждый день в таблицу, чтобы отслеживать его.

В течение дня спрашивайте себя:
Нормальный ли у меня уровень энергии?
Становится ли мне более трудно дышать при выполнении обычных повседневных дел?
Стали ли моя одежда или обувь тесными?
Отекают ли у меня лодыжки или ноги?
Кашляю ли я чаще? Звучит ли мой кашель влажно...</div>

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can no longer effectively pump oxygen-rich blood to the other parts of the body. When symptoms become severe, a hospital stay may be needed. This article explains what you need to do to take care of yourself after being discharged from the hospital.

When you are in the hospital  
You were in the hospital for treatment of heart failure. Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle is weakened or does not relax well, or both together.

Your heart is a pump that moves fluids through your body. Like any pump, if the outflow from it is insufficient, fluids do not move well and stagnate where they should not. In your body this means that fluid accumulates in the lungs, abdominal cavity, and legs.

While you were in the hospital:
Your medical team carefully regulated the amount of fluid you drank or received through an intravenous (IV) line. They also monitored and measured how much urine you passed.
You may have been prescribed medicines that help the body get rid of excess fluid.
You may have undergone tests to check how well your heart is working.

What to expect at home  
Your energy will gradually return. At first, when you return home, you may need help taking care of yourself. You may feel sad or depressed. All of this is normal.

Self-monitoring at home  
Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale right after waking up – before eating, but after using the toilet. Make sure that each time you weigh yourself in similar clothing. Record your weight every day in a chart to track it.

During the day ask yourself:
Is my energy level normal?
Is it becoming more difficult for me to breathe when doing my usual daily activities?
Have my clothes or shoes become tight?
Are my ankles or legs swelling?
Am I coughing more often? Does my cough sound wet?
Do I get short of breath at night or when I lie down?

Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told. Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines with it or at different times, and eating certain foods can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

What to Expect at Home
Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. This may be important if:

You have already had blood clots in your leg, arm, heart, or brain.
Your health care provider is worried that a blood clot may form in your body. People who have a new heart valve, a large heart, a heart rhythm that is not normal, or other heart problems may need to take warfarin.
When you are taking warfarin, you may be more likely to bleed, even from activities you have always done.

Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines, and eating certain foods all can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

Taking Warfarin
It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told.

Take only the dose your provider has prescribed. If you miss a dose, contact your provider for advice.
If your pills look different from your last prescription, contact your provider or pharmacist right away. The tablets are different colors, depending on the dose. The dose is also marked on the pill.
Your provider will test your blood at regular visits. This is called an INR test or sometimes a PT test. The test helps make sure you are taking the right amount of warfarin to help your body.

Alcohol and some medicines can change how warfarin works in your body.

DO NOT drink alcohol while you are taking warfarin.
Talk with your provider before taking any other over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, supplements, cold medicines, antibiotics, or other medicines.

            <div class='text-box translated'>Прием варфарина

Варфарин — это лекарство, которое снижает вероятность образования тромбов (сгустков крови). Очень важно принимать варфарин точно так, как вам сказали. Изменение схемы приема варфарина, прием других лекарств вместе с ним или в другое время, а также употребление определенных продуктов могут изменить действие варфарина в вашем организме. Если это произойдет, у вас может повыситься риск образования тромба или возникновения кровотечения.

Чего ожидать дома  
Варфарин — это лекарство, которое снижает вероятность образования тромбов. Это может быть важно, если:

У вас уже были тромбы в ноге, руке, сердце или мозге.
Ваш лечащий врач беспокоится, что в вашем организме может образоваться тромб. Людям с новым сердечным клапаном, увеличенным сердцем, нарушением сердечного ритма или другими проблемами с сердцем может понадобиться прием варфарина.
Когда вы принимаете варфарин, у вас может быть более высокий риск кровотечения, даже при обычных для вас занятиях.

Изменение схемы приема варфарина, прием других лекарств и употребление определенных продуктов могут изменить действие варфарина в вашем организме. Если это произойдет, у вас может повыситься риск образования тромба или возникновения кровотечения.

Прием варфарина  
Очень важно принимать варфарин точно так, как вам сказали.

Принимайте только ту дозу, которую назначил ваш врач. Если вы пропустили дозу, свяжитесь с врачом за советом.
Если ваши таблетки выглядят иначе, чем в прошлый раз по рецепту, немедленно свяжитесь с врачом или фармацевтом. Таблетки имеют разный цвет в зависимости от дозы. Доза также указана на таблетке.

When your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the pressure of the blood against the artery walls is called your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is given as two numbers: systolic over diastolic blood pressure. Your systolic blood pressure is the highest blood pressure during the course of your heart beat cycle. Your diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure.

When your blood pressure gets too high, it puts extra stress on your heart and blood vessels. If your blood pressure stays high all the time, you will be at a higher risk for heart attacks and other vascular (blood vessel) diseases, strokes, kidney disease, and other health problems.

Below are questions you may want to ask your health care provider to help you take care of your blood pressure.

Questions

Когда ваше сердце перекачивает кровь в артерии, давление крови на стенки артерий называется вашим кровяным давлением. Ваше кровяное давление записывается двумя числами: систолическое и диастолическое давление. Ваше систолическое давление – это наибольшее давление крови в течение одного цикла сердечного сокращения. Ваше диастолическое давление – это наименьшее давление.

Когда ваше кровяное давление становится слишком высоким, это создает дополнительную нагрузку на сердце и кровеносные сосуды. Если ваше давление постоянно остается высоким, у вас повышается риск инфаркта миокарда и других сосудистых (заболеваний кровеносных сосудов), инсульта, заболеваний почек и других проблем со здоровьем.

Ниже приведены вопросы, которые вы можете задать своему лечащему врачу, чтобы лучше контролировать свое кровяное давление.

Вопросы
Как я могу изменить свой образ жизни, чтобы снизить кровяное давление?

Что такое полезная для сердца диета? Можно ли иногда есть пищу, которая не является полезной для сердца? Как можно питаться здоровее, когда я хожу в ресторан?
Нужно ли мне ограничивать количество соли? Есть ли другие приправы, которые я могу использовать, чтобы еда была вкусной?
Можно ли мне употреблять алкоголь? Сколько можно?
Что я могу сделать, чтобы бросить курить? Можно ли мне находиться рядом с другими людьми, которые курят?
Нужно ли мне измерять кровяное давление дома?

Какое оборудование мне нужно купить? Где я могу научиться им пользоваться?
Как часто мне нужно измерять кровяное давление? Нужно ли мне записывать показатели и приносить их на следующий прием?

Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.

What is Low Blood Sugar?
Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.

You are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:

Insulin
Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)
You are also at increased risk of having low blood sugar if you have had previous low blood sugar levels.

Recognizing Low Blood Sugar
Know how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:

Weakness or feeling tired
Shaking
Sweating
Headache
Hunger
Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious
Feeling cranky
Trouble thinking clearly
Double or blurry vision
Fast or pounding heartbeat
Sometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:

Faint
Have a seizure
Go into a coma
Some people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.

Check Your Blood Sugar Often
Talk with your provider about when you should check your blood sugar every day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.

The most common causes of low blood sugar are:

Taking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time
Taking too much insul...</div>

            <div class='text-box translated'>Низкий уровень сахара в крови – самопомощь

Низкий уровень сахара в крови – это состояние, при котором уровень сахара (глюкозы) в крови ниже нормы. Низкий уровень сахара в крови может возникать у людей с диабетом, которые принимают инсулин или некоторые другие лекарства для контроля диабета. Низкий уровень сахара в крови может вызывать опасные симптомы. Научитесь распознавать симптомы низкого уровня сахара в крови и предотвращать их.

Что такое низкий уровень сахара в крови?
Низкий уровень сахара в крови называется гипогликемией. Уровень сахара в крови ниже 70 мг/дл (3,9 ммоль/л) считается низким и может нанести вам вред. Уровень сахара в крови ниже 54 мг/дл (3,0 ммоль/л) требует немедленных действий.

У вас есть риск низкого уровня сахара в крови, если у вас диабет и вы принимаете любые из следующих лекарств от диабета:

Инсулин
Глибурид (Micronase), глипизид (Glucotrol), глимепирид (Amaryl), репаглинид (Prandin) или натеглинид (Starlix)
У вас также повышен риск низкого уровня сахара в крови, если у вас уже были эпизоды низкого уровня сахара в крови.

Распознавание низкого уровня сахара в крови
Знайте, как понять, что ваш уровень сахара в крови снижается. Симптомы включают:

Слабость или чувство усталости
Дрожь
Потоотделение
Головная боль
Чувство голода
Чувство беспокойства, нервозности или тревоги
Раздражительность
Затруднение ясного мышления
Двоение в глазах или нечеткое зрение
Учащенное или сильное сердцебиение
Иногда уровень сахара в крови может быть слишком низким, даже если у вас нет симптомов. Если он становится слишком низким, вы можете:

Потерять сознание
Испытать судороги
Впасть в кому
У некоторых людей, которые долго болеют диабетом, пропадает способность чувствовать низкий уровень сахара в крови. Это называется гипогликемической неосознанностью. Спросите у вашего медицинского работника, может ли ношение системы непрерывного мониторинга глюкозы и сенсора помочь вам обнаружить, когда уровень сахара в крови становится слишком низким, чтобы предотвратить си...</div>

Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)
You are also at increased risk for low blood sugar if you have had episodes of low blood sugar before.

Recognizing low blood sugar
Learn to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:

Weakness or feeling tired
Shaking
Sweating
Headache
Hunger
Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious
Irritability
Trouble thinking clearly
Double or blurry vision
Fast or pounding heartbeat
Sometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:

Faint
Have a seizure
Go into a coma
Some people who have had diabetes for a long time no longer feel low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemia unawareness. Ask your health care provider if using a continuous glucose monitoring system with a sensor can help you detect falling blood sugar to prevent symptoms.

Check your blood sugar often
Talk to your doctor about when you should check your blood sugar each day. People with low blood sugar need to check it more often.

The most common causes of low blood sugar are:

Taking insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time
Taking too much insulin or diabetes medicine
Giving insulin to correct high blood sugar without eating food

Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.

What is Low Blood Sugar?
Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.

You are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:

Insulin
Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)
You are also at increased risk of having low blood sugar if you have had previous low blood sugar levels.

Recognizing Low Blood Sugar
Know how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:

Weakness or feeling tired
Shaking
Sweating
Headache
Hunger
Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious
Feeling cranky
Trouble thinking clearly
Double or blurry vision
Fast or pounding heartbeat
Sometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:

Faint
Have a seizure
Go into a coma
Some people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.

Check Your Blood Sugar Often

Низкий уровень сахара в крови — это состояние, которое возникает, когда уровень сахара (глюкозы) в вашей крови ниже нормы. Низкий уровень сахара может возникнуть у людей с диабетом, которые принимают инсулин или определенные другие лекарства для контроля диабета. Низкий уровень сахара в крови может вызывать опасные симптомы. Узнайте, как распознать симптомы низкого уровня сахара и как их предотвратить.

Что такое низкий уровень сахара в крови?
Низкий уровень сахара в крови называется гипогликемией. Уровень сахара в крови ниже 70 мг/дл (3,9 ммоль/л) является низким и может нанести вам вред. Уровень сахара в крови ниже 54 мг/дл (3,0 ммоль/л) требует немедленных действий.

Вы находитесь в группе риска по низкому уровню сахара, если у вас диабет и вы принимаете любое из следующих лекарств от диабета:

*   Инсулин
*   Глибурид (Micronase), глипизид (Glucotrol), глимепирид (Amaryl), репаглинид (Prandin) или натеглинид (Starlix)

Риск также повышается, если у вас ранее уже снижался уровень сахара в крови.

Как распознать низкий уровень сахара в крови
Знайте, как определить, что уровень сахара в крови падает. Симптомы включают:

*   Слабость или чувство усталости
*   Дрожь
*   Потливость
*   Головная боль
*   Чувство голода
*   Беспокойство, нервозность или тревога
*   Раздражительность
*   Трудности с ясным мышлением
*   Двоение в глазах или нечеткое зрение
*   Учащенное или сильное сердцебиение

Иногда уровень сахара может быть слишком низким даже при отсутствии симптомов. Если он упадет слишком низко, вы можете:

*   Потерять сознание
*   Испытать судороги
*   Впасть в кому

Некоторые люди, болеющие диабетом долгое время, перестают чувствовать снижение сахара. Это называется нечувствительностью к гипогликемии. Спросите своего лечащего врача, поможет ли вам ношение непрерывного монитора глюкозы (сенсора), чтобы определять падение уровня сахара и предотвращать симптомы.

Чаще проверяйте уровень сахара в крови
Обсудите с врачом, к...</div>

The risk also increases if your blood sugar level has dropped before.

How to recognize low blood sugar
Know how to determine that blood sugar level is falling. Symptoms include:

*   Weakness or feeling tired
*   Shaking
*   Sweating
*   Headache
*   Feeling of hunger
*   Restlessness, nervousness or anxiety
*   Irritability
*   Difficulty thinking clearly

*   Lose consciousness
*   Experience seizures
*   Fall into a coma

Some people who have had diabetes for a long time stop feeling the drop in sugar. This is called hypoglycemia unawareness. Ask your treating doctor if wearing a continuous glucose monitor (sensor) will help you detect a drop in sugar level and prevent symptoms.

Asthma quick-relief medicines work fast to control asthma symptoms. You take them when you are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack. They are also called rescue medicines.

Many of these medicines are called "bronchodilators" because they open (dilate) and help relax the muscles of your airways (bronchi).

You and your health care provider can make a plan for the quick-relief medicines that work for you. This plan will include when you should take them and how much you should take.

Plan ahead. Make sure you do not run out. Bring enough medicine with you when you travel.

Short-acting Beta-agonists
Short-acting beta-agonists are the most common quick-relief medicines for treating asthma attacks and are considered to be bronchodilators.

They can be used just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise. They work by relaxing the muscles of your airways, and this lets you breathe better during an attack.

Tell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more to control your asthma symptoms. Your asthma may not be under control, and your provider may need to change your dose of daily control medicines.

Some quick-relief asthma medicines include:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline
Short-acting beta-agonists may cause these side effects:

Anxiety.
Fast and irregular heartbeats. Call your provider right away if you have this side effect.
Headache.
Restlessness.
Tremor (your hand or another part of your body may shake).
Oral Steroids
Your provider might prescribe oral steroids when you have an asthma attack that is not going away. These are medicines that you take by mouth as pills, capsules, or liquids.

Oral steroids are not quick-relief medicines but are often given for 7 to 14 days when your symptoms flare-up.

Препараты быстрого действия при астме действуют быстро, чтобы контролировать симптомы астмы. Вы принимаете их, когда кашляете, хрипите, испытываете затрудненное дыхание или у вас приступ астмы. Их также называют «препаратами скорой помощи» или «спасательными препаратами».

Многие из этих препаратов называются «бронходилататорами», потому что они расширяют (дилатируют) и помогают расслабить мышцы ваших дыхательных путей (бронхов).

Вы и ваш лечащий врач можете составить план приема препаратов быстрого действия, которые подходят именно вам. В этот план будет входить, когда вы должны их принимать и в какой дозе.

Планируйте заранее. Убедитесь, что у вас не заканчиваются лекарства. Берите с собой достаточное количество препарата, когда путешествуете.

Короткодействующие бета-агонисты
Короткодействующие бета-агонисты являются наиболее распространенными препаратами быстрого действия для лечения приступов астмы и считаются бронходилататорами.

Их можно использовать непосредственно перед физической нагрузкой, чтобы предотвратить симптомы астмы, вызванные нагрузкой. Они действуют, расслабляя мышцы ваших дыхательных путей, что позволяет вам дышать лучше во время приступа.

Сообщите своему врачу, если вы используете препараты быстрого действия два раза в неделю или чаще, чтобы контролировать симптомы астмы. Ваша астма может быть недостаточно контролируемой, и врачу может потребоваться изменить дозу ваших препаратов для ежедневного контроля.

An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the kind of surgery you had.

Sometimes, an incision breaks open. This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).

What to Expect at Home
If your surgeon does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. A dressing helps absorb drainage and keep the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.

Proper Handwashing
It is important to clean your hands before you change your dressing. You can use an alcohol-based cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands using these steps:

Take all jewelry off your hands.
Wet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.
Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or the "Alphabet Song" one time through). Clean under your nails also.
Rinse well.
Dry with a clean towel.
Removing the Old Dressing
Your health care provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. To prepare for the dressing change:

Clean your hands before touching the dressing.
Make sure you have all the supplies handy.
Have a clean work surface.
Remove the old dressing:

Carefully loosen the tape from your skin.
Use a clean (not sterile) medical glove to grab the old dressing and pull it off.
If the dressing sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your provider instructed you to pull it off dry.
Put the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.
Clean your hands again after you take off the old dressing.
Caring for the Wound
You may use a gauze pad or soft cloth to clean the skin around your wound:

Use a normal saline solution (salt water) or mild soapy water.
Soak the gauze or cloth in the saline solutio...</div>

Разрез – это надрез кожи, который делается во время операции. Его также называют хирургической раной. Некоторые разрезы маленькие, другие – длинные. Размер разреза зависит от того, какая операция была проведена.

Иногда разрез раскрывается. Это может произойти по всей длине разреза или только на его части. Ваш хирург может решить не закрывать его снова швами (stitches).

Чего ожидать дома  
Если ваш хирург не закрыл рану снова швами, вам нужно ухаживать за ней дома, так как заживление может занять время. Рана будет заживать снизу вверх. Повязка помогает впитывать выделения и не дает коже закрыться раньше, чем заполнится рана под ней.

Правильное мытьё рук  
Важно очищать руки перед тем, как менять повязку. Вы можете использовать антисептик на спиртовой основе. Или вы можете мыть руки, выполняя следующие шаги:

Снимите с рук все украшения.  
Намочите руки, держа их пальцами вниз под тёплой проточной водой.  
Нанесите мыло и мойте руки 15–30 секунд (спойте песню «Happy Birthday» или «Alphabet Song» один раз полностью). Очистите также под ногтями.  
Тщательно смойте мыло.  
Высушите руки чистым полотенцем.  

Снятие старой повязки  
Ваш медицинский работник скажет вам, как часто нужно менять повязку. Чтобы подготовиться к смене повязки:

Вымойте руки перед тем, как трогать повязку.  
Убедитесь, что все необходимые материалы находятся под рукой.  
Подготовьте чистую рабочую поверхность.  

Снимите старую повязку:

Осторожно отделите ленту (пластырь) от кожи.  
Используйте чистую (нестерильную) медицинскую перчатку, чтобы взять старую повязку и снять её.  
Если повязка прилипла к ране, намочите её и попробуйте снять снова, если только ваш врач не сказал снимать её насухо.  
Положите старую повязку в пластиковый пакет и отложите в сторону.

You had surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint called a prosthesis. This article tells you what you need to do to care for your new hip when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You had a hip joint replacement surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.

What to Expect at Home
By the time you go home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without needing much help. Most people do not need them after 2 to 4 weeks. Check with your surgeon about when to stop using crutches.

You should also be able to dress yourself with only a little help and be able to get into and out of your bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help.

You will need to be careful that you do not dislocate your artificial hip, especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions.

You will need to have someone with you at home for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehab center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.

Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.

Home Setup
Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You may not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.

Keep tripping hazards out of your home.

Вам была выполнена операция по замене всего или части тазобедренного сустава искусственным суставом, который называется протезом. В этой памятке рассказывается, что нужно делать для ухода за новым суставом после выписки из больницы.

Когда вы в больнице  
Вам была выполнена операция по эндопротезированию тазобедренного сустава, то есть замене всего или части сустава искусственным суставом. Этот искусственный сустав называется протезом.

Чего ожидать дома  
К моменту выписки вы должны уметь ходить с ходунками или костылями, почти не нуждаясь в помощи. Большинству людей они не нужны уже через 2–4 недели. Уточните у своего хирурга, когда можно перестать пользоваться костылями.

Вы также должны уметь одеваться почти без помощи и самостоятельно ложиться и вставать с кровати или стула. Вы также должны уметь пользоваться туалетом без значительной помощи.

Вам нужно быть осторожным, чтобы не вывихнуть искусственный тазобедренный сустав, особенно в первые несколько месяцев после операции. Вам нужно будет выучить упражнения для укрепления нового сустава и соблюдать особые меры предосторожности.

После выписки из больницы или реабилитационного центра вам понадобится человек, который будет с вами дома 1–2 недели. Вам понадобится помощь в приготовлении пищи, купании, передвижении по дому и выполнении других повседневных дел.

Со временем вы сможете вернуться к прежнему уровню активности. Однако вам нужно будет избегать некоторых видов спорта, таких как горные лыжи или контактные виды спорта, например футбол и соккер. Но вы сможете заниматься видами активности с низкой нагрузкой, такими как пешие прогулки, садоводство, плавание, игра в теннис и гольф.

Обстановка дома  
Ваша кровать должна быть достаточно низкой, чтобы, сидя на краю, вы могли доставать ногами до пола. При этом она должна быть достаточно высокой, чтобы при сидении на краю кровати бедра были выше коленей. Больничная кровать может и не понадобиться, но матрас долж...</div>

When you are in the hospital  
You have had an operation for hip joint replacement, that is, replacement of all or part of the joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.

What to expect at home  
By the time of discharge you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches, almost without needing help. Most people no longer need them after 2–4 weeks. Check with your surgeon when you can stop using crutches.

You should also be able to get dressed almost without help and to get in and out of bed or a chair on your own. You should also be able to use the toilet without significant help.

You need to be careful not to dislocate the artificial hip joint, especially in the first few months after the operation. You will need to learn exercises to strengthen the new joint and follow special precautions.

After discharge from the hospital or rehabilitation center you will need someone to be with you at home for 1–2 weeks. You will need help with cooking, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other everyday tasks.

Over time you will be able to return to your previous level of activity. However, you will need to avoid certain sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports, for example football and soccer. But you will be able to do low‑impact activities such as walking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis and golf.

Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.

Home Setup
Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You may not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.

Keep tripping hazards out of your home.

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is no longer able to pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body efficiently. When symptoms become severe, a hospital stay may be necessary. This article discusses what you need to do to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You were in the hospital to have your heart failure treated. Heart failure occurs when the muscles of your heart are weak or have trouble relaxing, or both.

Your heart is a pump that moves fluids through your body. As with any pump, if the flow out of the pump is not enough, fluids do not move well and they get stuck in places they should not be. In your body, this means that fluid collects in your lungs, abdomen, and legs.

While you were in the hospital:
Your health care team closely adjusted the fluids you drank or received through an intravenous (IV) line. They also watched and measured how much urine you produced.
You may have received medicines to help your body get rid of extra fluids.
You may have had tests to check how well your heart was working.

What to Expect at Home
Your energy will slowly return. You may need help taking care of yourself when you first get home. You may feel sad or depressed. All of these things are normal.

Checking Yourself at Home
Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale when you get up -- before you eat but after you use the bathroom. Make sure you are wearing similar clothing each time you weigh yourself. Write down your weight every day on a chart so that you can keep track of it.

Throughout the day, ask yourself:
Is my energy level normal?
Do I get more short of breath when I am doing my everyday activities?
Are my clothes or shoes feeling tight?
Are my ankles or legs swelling?
Am I coughing more often? Does my cough sound wet?
Do I get short of breath at night or when I lie down?

If you are having new (or different) symptoms, ask yourself:

Did I eat something different than usua...</div>

            <div class='text-box translated'>Сердечная недостаточность — выписка из больницы

Сердечная недостаточность — это состояние, при котором сердце больше не может эффективно перекачивать кровь, богатую кислородом, к остальным частям тела. Когда симптомы становятся тяжёлыми, может потребоваться госпитализация. В этой статье рассказывается, что вам нужно делать, чтобы заботиться о себе, когда вы выписываетесь из больницы.

Когда вы находитесь в больнице

Вы находились в больнице для лечения сердечной недостаточности. Сердечная недостаточность возникает, когда мышцы вашего сердца ослаблены или им трудно расслабляться, или и то, и другое вместе.

Ваше сердце — это насос, который перемещает жидкости по всему организму. Как и любой насос, если поток из насоса недостаточен, жидкости плохо движутся и застаиваются в местах, где им не следует быть. В вашем организме это означает, что жидкость скапливается в лёгких, брюшной полости и ногах.

Пока вы находились в больнице:
• Ваша команда медицинских работников тщательно регулировала количество жидкости, которую вы пили или получали через внутривенную (IV) капельницу. Они также следили за тем, сколько мочи вы выделяли, и измеряли её количество.
• Вам могли дать лекарства, чтобы помочь вашему организму избавиться от лишней жидкости.
• Вам могли сделать анализы, чтобы проверить, как работает ваше сердце.

Чего ожидать дома

Ваша энергия постепенно вернётся. Вам может потребоваться помощь в уходе за собой, когда вы впервые вернётесь домой. Вы можете чувствовать себя грустным или подавленным. Все это нормально.

Контроль состояния дома

Взвешивайте себя каждое утро на одних и тех же весах, когда встаёте, — до еды, но после того, как сходили в туалет. Убедитесь, что каждый раз вы носите похожую одежду. Записывайте свой вес каждый день в таблице, чтобы отслеживать его.

В течение дня задавайте себе вопросы:
• Мой уровень энергии в норме?
• Я быстрее задыхаюсь, когда занимаюсь повседневными делами?
• Моя одежда или обувь становятся тесными?
• Мои лодыжки или ноги отекают...</div>

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can no longer effectively pump oxygen-rich blood to the other parts of the body. When symptoms become severe, hospitalization may be required. This article explains what you need to do to take care of yourself when you are discharged from the hospital.

When you are in the hospital

You were in the hospital for treatment of heart failure. Heart failure occurs when the muscles of your heart are weakened or it is difficult for them to relax, or both together.

Your heart is a pump which moves fluids throughout the body. Like any pump, if the flow from the pump is insufficient, fluids move poorly and stagnate in places where they should not be. In your body this means that fluid accumulates in the lungs, abdominal cavity and legs.

While you were in the hospital:
• Your team of medical workers carefully regulated the amount of fluid which you drank or received through an intravenous (IV) drip. They also monitored how much urine you excreted and measured its amount.
• You may have been given medications to help your body get rid of excess fluid.
• You may have had tests done to check how your heart is working.

What to expect at home

Your energy will gradually return. You may need help in caring for yourself when you first return home. You may feel sad or depressed. All this is normal.

Monitoring condition at home

Weigh yourself every morning on the same scales when you get up — before eating, but after you have gone to the toilet. Make sure that each time you wear similar clothing. Record your weight every day in a table to track it.

During the day ask yourself questions:
• Is my energy level normal?
• Am I getting out of breath faster when I do everyday things?

You may feel sadness. You may feel anxiety and a feeling that you must be very careful in your actions. All these feelings are normal. In most people they pass within 2–3 weeks. You may also feel fatigue when you are discharged from the hospital.

Activity
You must know the signs and symptoms of angina.

- You may feel pressure, squeezing, burning or tightness in the chest. You may also notice these symptoms in the arms, shoulders, neck, jaw, throat or back.
- Some people also feel discomfort in the back, shoulders and abdominal area.
- You may have heartburn or nausea.
- You may feel fatigue, shortness of breath, sweating, dizziness or weakness.

Angina may occur during physical activity, for example, when climbing stairs or walking uphill, lifting weights, sexual activity or being in the cold. It may also occur at rest or wake you during sleep.
Know how to treat chest pain when it occurs. Talk with your treating doctor about what to do.

Take care of yourself in the first 4–6 weeks after myocardial infarction.

- Avoid lifting weights. If possible, ask for help with household chores.
- Rest 30–60 minutes during the day in the first 4–6 weeks. Try to go to bed early and get enough sleep.
- Before starting sports activities your doctor may prescribe you a test with physical load and recommend an exercise plan. This may happen before discharge from the hospital or soon after it. Do not change the exercise plan without...</div>

When your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the pressure of the blood against the artery walls is called your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is given as two numbers: systolic over diastolic blood pressure. Your systolic blood pressure is the highest blood pressure during the course of your heart beat cycle. Your diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure.

When your blood pressure gets too high, it puts extra stress on your heart and blood vessels. If your blood pressure stays high all the time, you will be at a higher risk for heart attacks and other vascular (blood vessel) diseases, strokes, kidney disease, and other health problems.

Below are questions you may want to ask your health care provider to help you take care of your blood pressure.

Questions
How can I change the way I live to lower my blood pressure?

What is a heart-healthy diet? Is it OK to ever eat something that is not heart healthy? What are some ways to eat healthy when I go to a restaurant?
Do I need to limit how much salt I use? Are there other spices that I can use to make my food taste good?
Is it OK to drink alcohol? How much is OK?

Когда ваше сердце перекачивает кровь по артериям, давление крови против стенок артерий называется кровяным давлением. Кровяное давление измеряется двумя числами: систолическое над диастолическим кровяным давлением. Систолическое кровяное давление — это самое высокое давление в течение цикла сердечных сокращений. Диастолическое кровяное давление — это самое низкое давление.

Когда кровяное давление становится слишком высоким, это создает дополнительную нагрузку на сердце и кровеносные сосуды. Если кровяное давление остается высоким постоянно, у вас повышается риск инфарктов и других сосудистых заболеваний, инсультов, заболеваний почек и других проблем со здоровьем.

Ниже приведены вопросы, которые вы можете задать своему медицинскому работнику, чтобы помочь контролировать кровяное давление.

Вопросы
Как я могу изменить образ жизни, чтобы снизить кровяное давление?

Что такое диета, полезная для сердца? Можно ли иногда есть что-то, что не является полезным для сердца? Как можно питаться правильно, когда я хожу в ресторан?
Нужно ли мне ограничивать количество соли? Есть ли другие специи, которые я могу использовать, чтобы сделать еду вкусной?
Можно ли пить алкоголь? Какое количество допустимо?
Что я могу сделать, чтобы бросить курить? Можно ли находиться рядом с людьми, которые курят?

Должен ли я измерять кровяное давление дома?

Какое оборудование мне следует купить? Где я могу научиться им пользоваться?
Как часто мне нужно измерять кровяное давление? Следует ли мне записывать показания и приносить их на следующий прием?
Если я не могу измерять кровяное давление сам, где еще я могу его измерить?
Какими должны быть мои показания кровяного давления? Следует ли мне отдохнуть перед измерением кровяного давления?

Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.

What is Low Blood Sugar?
Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.

You are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:

Insulin
Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)
You are also at increased risk of having low blood sugar if you have had previous low blood sugar levels.

Recognizing Low Blood Sugar
Know how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:

Weakness or feeling tired
Shaking
Sweating
Headache
Hunger
Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious
Feeling cranky
Trouble thinking clearly
Double or blurry vision
Fast or pounding heartbeat
Sometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:

Faint
Have a seizure
Go into a coma
Some people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.

Check Your Blood Sugar Often
Talk with your provider about when you should check your blood sugar every day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.

The most common causes of low blood sugar are:

Taking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time
Taking too much insul...</div>

            <div class='text-box translated'>Низкий уровень сахара в крови — самопомощь

Низкий уровень сахара в крови — это состояние, которое возникает, когда уровень сахара в крови (глюкозы) ниже нормы. Низкий уровень сахара в крови может возникать у людей с сахарным диабетом, которые принимают инсулин или некоторые другие лекарства для контроля диабета. Низкий уровень сахара в крови может вызывать опасные симптомы. Научитесь распознавать симптомы низкого уровня сахара в крови и предотвращать их.

Что такое низкий уровень сахара в крови?

Низкий уровень сахара в крови называется гипогликемией. Уровень сахара в крови ниже 70 мг/дл (3,9 ммоль/л) считается низким и может нанести вам вред. Уровень сахара в крови ниже 54 мг/дл (3,0 ммоль/л) является поводом для немедленных действий.

Вы находитесь в группе риска развития низкого уровня сахара в крови, если у вас сахарный диабет и вы принимаете любое из следующих лекарств от диабета:

- Инсулин
- Глибенкламид (Micronase), глипизид (Glucotrol), глимепирид (Amaryl), репаглинид (Prandin) или натеглинид (Starlix)

Также у вас повышен риск развития низкого уровня сахара в крови, если у вас уже были предыдущие случаи низкого уровня сахара.

Распознавание низкого уровня сахара в крови

Узнайте, как определить, когда уровень сахара в крови понижается. Симптомы включают:

- Слабость или усталость
- Дрожь
- Потливость
- Головная боль
- Чувство голода
- Беспокойство, нервозность или тревожность
- Раздражительность
- Затруднение ясного мышления
- Двоение в глазах или размытое зрение
- Учащенное или сильное сердцебиение

Иногда уровень сахара в крови может быть слишком низким, даже если у вас нет симптомов. Если он становится слишком низким, вы можете:

- Потерять сознание
- Испытать судороги
- Впасть в кому

Некоторые люди, которые страдают сахарным диабетом в течение длительного времени, перестают ощущать понижение уровня сахара в крови. Это называется гипогликемической неосознанностью. Спросите своего медицинского работника, может ли ношение непрерывного монитора глюкозы с...</div>

Asthma quick-relief medicines work fast to control asthma symptoms. You take them when you are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack. They are also called rescue medicines.

Many of these medicines are called "bronchodilators" because they open (dilate) and help relax the muscles of your airways (bronchi).

You and your health care provider can make a plan for the quick-relief medicines that work for you. This plan will include when you should take them and how much you should take.

Plan ahead. Make sure you do not run out. Bring enough medicine with you when you travel.

Short-acting Beta-agonists
Short-acting beta-agonists are the most common quick-relief medicines for treating asthma attacks and are considered to be bronchodilators.

They can be used just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise. They work by relaxing the muscles of your airways, and this lets you breathe better during an attack.

Tell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more to control your asthma symptoms. Your asthma may not be under control, and your provider may need to change your dose of daily control medicines.

Some quick-relief asthma medicines include:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline
Short-acting beta-agonists may cause these side effects:

Anxiety.
Fast and irregular heartbeats. Call your provider right away if you have this side effect.
Headache.
Restlessness.
Tremor (your hand or another part of your body may shake).
Oral Steroids
Your provider might prescribe oral steroids when you have an asthma attack that is not going away. These are medicines that you take by mouth as pills, capsules, or liquids.

Oral steroids are not quick-relief medicines but are often given for 7 to 14 days when your symptoms flare-up.

Oral steroids include:

Астма — лекарства быстрого действия

Лекарства быстрого действия при астме быстро работают, контролируя симптомы астмы. Вы принимаете их, когда кашляете, свистите в груди, испытываете затруднённое дыхание или у вас приступ астмы. Их также называют спасательными лекарствами.

Многие из этих лекарств называются «бронходилататорами», потому что они открывают (расширяют) и помогают расслабить мышцы ваших дыхательных путей (бронхов).

Вы и ваш лечащий врач можете составить план по применению лекарств быстрого действия, которые подходят вам. Этот план будет включать, когда вам следует их принимать и какую дозу принимать.

Планируйте заранее. Убедитесь, что у вас не заканчиваются лекарства. Берите с собой достаточно лекарств, когда путешествуете.

Короткодействующие бета-агонисты

Короткодействующие бета-агонисты — наиболее распространённые лекарства быстрого действия для лечения приступов астмы и считаются бронходилататорами.

Их можно использовать непосредственно перед физическими упражнениями, чтобы помочь предотвратить симптомы астмы, вызванные нагрузкой. Они действуют, расслабляя мышцы ваших дыхательных путей, и это позволяет вам лучше дышать во время приступа.

Сообщите своему врачу, если вы используете лекарства быстрого действия дважды в неделю или чаще для контроля симптомов астмы. Ваша астма может быть неконтролируемой, и вашему врачу может потребоваться изменить дозу ежедневных лекарств для контроля.

К некоторым лекарствам быстрого действия при астме относятся:

Альбутерол (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Левальбутерол (Xopenex HFA)
Метапротеренол
Тербуталин

Короткодействующие бета-агонисты могут вызывать следующие побочные эффекты:

Тревога.
Учащённое и неровное сердцебиение. Немедленно позвоните своему врачу, если у вас появится этот побочный эффект.
Головная боль.
Беспокойство.
Тремор (ваша рука или другая часть тела может дрожать).

Fast-acting medications for asthma work quickly, controlling symptoms of asthma. You take them when you cough, wheeze in your chest, experience difficult breathing or you have an asthma attack. They are also called rescue medications.

Many of these medications are called "bronchodilators" because they open (widen) and help relax the muscles of your airways (bronchi).

You and your treating physician can compose a plan for the use of fast-acting medications that are suitable for you. This plan will include when you should take them and what dose to take.

Plan ahead. Make sure that you do not run out of medications. Take with you enough medications when you travel.

Short-acting beta-agonists

Short-acting beta-agonists are the most common fast-acting medications for the treatment of asthma attacks and are considered bronchodilators.

They can be used directly before physical exercises to help prevent symptoms of asthma caused by exertion. They act by relaxing the muscles of your airways, and this allows you to breathe better during an attack.

Inform your doctor if you use fast-acting medications twice a week or more often for controlling symptoms of asthma. Your asthma may be uncontrolled, and your doctor may need to change the dose of daily medications for control.

Some fast-acting medications for asthma include:

Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA)
Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)
Metaproterenol
Terbutaline

Short-acting beta-agonists can cause the following side effects:

An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the kind of surgery you had.

Sometimes, an incision breaks open. This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).

What to Expect at Home
If your surgeon does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. A dressing helps absorb drainage and keep the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.

Proper Handwashing
It is important to clean your hands before you change your dressing. You can use an alcohol-based cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands using these steps:

Take all jewelry off your hands.
Wet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.
Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or the "Alphabet Song" one time through). Clean under your nails also.
Rinse well.
Dry with a clean towel.
Removing the Old Dressing
Your health care provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. To prepare for the dressing change:

Clean your hands before touching the dressing.
Make sure you have all the supplies handy.
Have a clean work surface.
Remove the old dressing:

Carefully loosen the tape from your skin.
Use a clean (not sterile) medical glove to grab the old dressing and pull it off.
If the dressing sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your provider instructed you to pull it off dry.
Put the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.
Clean your hands again after you take off the old dressing.
Caring for the Wound
You may use a gauze pad or soft cloth to clean the skin around your wound:

Разрез — это надрез кожи, который делается во время операции. Его также называют хирургической раной. Некоторые разрезы бывают небольшими, другие — длинными. Размер разреза зависит от типа проведенной операции.

Иногда разрез раскрывается. Это может произойти по всей длине разреза или только по части его. Ваш хирург может решить не зашивать его повторно.

Чего ожидать дома

Если ваш хирург не закрыл рану повторно швами, вам нужно ухаживать за ней дома, так как заживление может занять время. Рана будет заживать снизу вверх. Повязка помогает впитывать отделяемое и не дает коже сомкнуться раньше, чем заполнится рана изнутри.

Правильное мытье рук

Важно вымыть руки перед сменой повязки. Вы можете использовать спиртосодержащий антисептик. Или вы можете вымыть руки, выполнив следующие шаги:

1. Снимите все украшения с рук.
2. Смочите руки, держа их направленными вниз под теплой проточной водой.
3. Нанесите мыло и мойте руки 15–30 секунд (пропойте песню «Happy Birthday» или «Alphabet Song» один раз). Также очистите область под ногтями.
4. Хорошо смойте мыло.
5. Вытрите руки чистым полотенцем.

Снятие старой повязки

Ваш медицинский работник скажет вам, как часто менять повязку. Чтобы подготовиться к смене повязки:

- Вымойте руки, прежде чем прикасаться к повязке.
- Убедитесь, что у вас под рукой все необходимые материалы.
- Рабочая поверхность должна быть чистой.

Снимите старую повязку:

- Аккуратно отклейте лейкопластырь от кожи.
- Используйте чистую (не стерильную) медицинскую перчатку, чтобы схватить старую повязку и снять ее.
- Если повязка прилипла к ране, смочите ее и попробуйте снова, если только ваш медицинский работник не сказал снимать ее сухой.
- Положите старую повязку в пластиковый пакет и отложите в сторону.
- Вымойте руки повторно после снятия старой повязки.

Уход за раной

Вы можете использовать марлевую салфетку или мягкую ткань, чтобы очистить кожу вокруг раны:

Incision is a cut of skin that is made during operation. It is also called surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. Size of incision depends on type of performed operation.

Sometimes incision opens. This can happen along entire length of incision or only part of it. Your surgeon may decide not to suture it again.

What to expect at home

If your surgeon did not close wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since healing may take time. Wound will heal from bottom to top. Dressing helps absorb discharge and does not allow skin to close before wound fills from inside.

Proper hand washing

It is important to wash hands before changing dressing. You can use alcohol-containing antiseptic. Or you can wash hands, performing following steps:

1. Remove all jewelry from hands.
2. Wet hands, holding them directed downward under warm running water.
3. Apply soap and wash hands 15-30 seconds (sing song "Happy Birthday" or "Alphabet Song" one time). Also clean area under nails.
4. Rinse soap well.
5. Wipe hands with clean towel.

Removal of old dressing

Your medical worker will tell you how often to change dressing. To prepare for changing dressing:

- Wash hands before touching dressing.
- Make sure that you have all necessary materials at hand.
- Working surface should be clean.

- Use clean (non-sterile) medical glove to grab old dressing and remove it.
- If dressing stuck to wound, wet it and try again, unless your medical worker said to remove it dry.
- Put old dressing in plastic bag and set aside.
- Wash hands again after removal of old dressing.

Care for wound

You had surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint called a prosthesis. This article tells you what you need to do to care for your new hip when you leave the hospital.

When You're in the Hospital
You had a hip joint replacement surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.

What to Expect at Home
By the time you go home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without needing much help. Most people do not need them after 2 to 4 weeks. Check with your surgeon about when to stop using crutches.

You should also be able to dress yourself with only a little help and be able to get into and out of your bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help.

You will need to be careful that you do not dislocate your artificial hip, especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions.

You will need to have someone with you at home for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehab center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.

Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.

Home Setup
Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You may not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.

Когда вы находитесь в больнице

Вам сделали операцию по замене тазобедренного сустава, в ходе которой полностью или частично заменили тазобедренный сустав искусственным суставом. Этот искусственный сустав называется протезом.

Чего ожидать дома

К моменту выписки вы должны быть способны ходить с ходунками или костылями, не нуждаясь в большой помощи. Большинству людей они не нужны через 2–4 недели. Уточните у вашего хирурга, когда можно перестать использовать костыли.

Вам нужно будет быть осторожным, чтобы не вывихнуть искусственный сустав, особенно в первые несколько месяцев после операции. Вам нужно будет научиться делать упражнения, которые сделают ваш новый сустав сильнее, и соблюдать особые меры предосторожности.

Вам понадобится, чтобы кто-то был с вами дома в течение 1–2 недель после выписки из больницы или реабилитационного центра. Вам понадобится помощь в приготовлении еды, купании, передвижении по дому и выполнении других повседневных дел.

Со временем вы должны быть способны вернуться к прежнему уровню активности. Вам нужно будет избегать некоторых видов спорта, таких как горные лыжи или контактные виды спорта, как американский футбол и футбол.

            <div class='text-box back-translated'>Hip joint endoprosthetics — discharge

You had an operation for complete or partial replacement of the hip joint with an artificial joint, which is called a prosthesis. This article tells what you need to do to take care of the new joint when you leave the hospital.

When you are in the hospital

You had an operation for replacement of the hip joint, during which the hip joint was completely or partially replaced with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.

What to expect at home

By the time of discharge you should be able to walk with walkers or crutches, not needing large assistance. For most people they are not needed in 2-4 weeks. Clarify with your surgeon when you can stop using crutches.

You also should be able to dress with small assistance and independently get up and sit down on a bed or chair. You also should be able to use the toilet without large assistance.

You will need to be careful not to dislocate the artificial joint, especially in the first few months after the operation. You will need to learn to do exercises that will make your new joint stronger, and observe special precautions.

You will need someone to be with you at home for 1-2 weeks after discharge from the hospital or rehabilitation center. You will need help with preparing food, bathing, moving around the house and performing other everyday tasks.

Over time you should be able to return to the previous level of activity. You will need to avoid some types of sports, such as alpine skiing or contact sports, like American football and football. But you should be able to engage in types of activity with low load, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, tennis and golf.

Preparing the home

Your bed should be low enough that your feet touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed also should be high enough that your hips are above the knees when you sit on the edge. You may not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.
